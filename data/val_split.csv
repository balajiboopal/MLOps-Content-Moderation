"""

I understand what you're saying, but this is not a disciplinary measure, it is further offence as an admin not only attacks my WQA response, but then conceals their attack by turning my behaviour into hyperbole to reduce their guilty. I don't apologise to people with such motives, or who serve protect themselves. The project only risks degenerating when sysop is left in the hands of people who abuse it. I maintain that the block is a front, a pretext. If reviewing admins are failing to take time to determine that and recognise the integrity of my claim, instead of taking Fram's for granted, which is contrary to """"we're all equals on wiki"""", then I will have no choice but to raise the matter elsewhere, such as RfC or ArbCom. This isn't about discipline, at my age I don't consider """"you can't login"""" as anything like you suggest, because it's not like losing wages. It's the principle of the matter. My contribs to WQA were meticulously used as spin against me, instead of the AGF everyone else saw them as. I don't intend to let Fram sit on a high horse any longer. Either they apologise first and withdraw their false assertions, or they'll have to explain them to RfC or ArbCom. Which I'm sure is much more complex and time consuming and stressful than admitting to any wrong-doing, but so be it, I stand for what I believe in and always have. I won't be bullied by someone like that. So really, the ball is in their court. If no one is counting coup, that applies to the admin who attacked me in an undignified manner, and continues to do so by maintaining their position – though now shielding themselves behind a wall of admins instead of facing up to the fact they erred. COI is clearly affecting their actions, or unwillingness to show face. They can either opt-in and admit they were wrong for their attack, or wait until a higher channel, one that even exceeds their stance, asks why they attacked my contribs and synthesised a despicable """"bad faith"""" conclusion. The consequences this dispute have yet to be determined.  [Chat • RFF] """,0

 Waterfalls 
Hamilton looks like an impressive place for waterfalls.  I""""ll certainly have to include it in my list of places to visit.  I can't speak for any of the areas in the Pacific Northwest (which is home to hundreds of high, impressive falls), in North Carolina, according to Kevin Adams' """"North Carolina Waterfalls: A Hiking and Photography Guide"""", our state is estimated to have around 1,000 - 1,500 falls in the state, most of them in Transylvania County, NC (aka """"The Land of Waterfalls"""").  Estimates are that TC contains between 400-500 """"major"""" waterfalls in an area slightly smaller than the City of Hamilton (390 sq mi versus Hamilton's 439 sq mi).  As for what you call """"major"""" - that's pretty much up to the viewer.  One man's gushing torrent is another man's damp spot on the side of a rock.  In TC, a major waterfall is usually considered at least 15-20' high - not including talus - or having enough current to be an obvious waterfall (such as Hooker Falls).

If you ever get the chance to visit NC, please do.  We've got a lot of beautiful, rugged country.  To this day, I get reports about new waterfalls discovered by people who are just now able to scamper through some of the roughest terrain the east coast has to offer.    

Part of the problem with defining the """"City with the most waterfalls"""" is that neither term is overly well defined.  """"City"""" can mean """"town limits"""" or """"Metropolitan Area"""" or any other of a dozen different definitions.  Then you have the problem with the exact definition of a waterfall.  Ergo, you have the problem.   

Trail in New Zealand
I don't know of another town with that many waterfalls.  However I do know that when it rains really heavily the valley that you walk up first on the Milford Track, has over 300 waterfalls. -

There are loads of waterfalls in Washington State in the Olympic and Cascade mountains.  I am only really documenting major waterfalls, not all the little ones.  Konrad

Regarding the 100 waterfalls Hamilton, I am unaware of another city area with that many.  There are probably """"areas"""" with about that much, such as the Columbia River Gorge, but the exact number there I am ignorant of and they are not that many major ones.  Here on the Olympic Peninsula we have a number of falls, but it is a really large area and probably does not reach the density that you have indicated there in Hamilton.  However it must be noted that I am a amateur at this and am ignorant of much

 Article status 

Archived from Talk:Reid Stowe/comments on the 15 June 2010 and removed two blacklisted external links.   

Article status

The period of time from 1978 to 1997 is not documented yet. Mr. Stowe conducted a five month voyage to Antartica with a crew of eight; originating from New Zealand
 Added summary information about the Antarctic trip, 1986 - 1987. As for the rest of the time, he seemed below the radar screens insofar as published information is concerned. —  
coverage of the actual start of the 1000 Days at Sea, commencing April 21, 2007, not in place yet.
 Added today —  
references are a bit thin; text has overdependence on an interview between Stowe and Hudson Channer: old (04-Aug-2003), and the interviewer only asked softball questions
There is a later Stowe/Channer interview that aired on 01-Apr-2005: have not reviewed it yet. —  
Reid Stowe is something of a media darling at http:goodnewsbroadcast.com; the material there may be of some use, but I found it to be light on content and long on good feelings.
Coverage of his activities from 2003 to 2007 is spotty; the New York Times seems to have lost interest in him.
I haven't tracked down real basic stuff yet: such as his exact date of birth.
surmised from the (removed blacklisted external). The Jan 08 2007 blog entry notes his birthday party on the previous day.
I've found few sources critical of Stowe; this causes me to raise one eyebrow. Good strong print references are presently hard to come by; Mr. Stowe is a bit of a media darling, and available material reflects that.  
Update:
Nothing in the article on his career as a fine artist. The project blog does make reference to sold paintings, but I don't have references yet documenting whether a gallery represents him or who has purchased his work recently. http://www.reidstowe.netfirms.com/ pesumably has some information, but is usually beyond its delivery capacity.
In 2005, Reid Stowe made a CD with S B, Reid and Suzanna The Bloodlines Some detils at CDBaby and International Herald Daily News. According to the first link, S.B. considered being a part of Mr. Stowe's crew, but decided against it for greatly differing """"philosophy’s and basic moral standards.""""  

Removed from the main article by  

Prison

Reid was arrested in Manhattan and extradited to Maine in 1991.  Reid's trial is public record via Docket #91-2365. His release from federal prison is documented via the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, but no details are given.

I do not claim that this is false, but I have reason to doubt that it is about the Reid Stowe of this article. Mr Stowe of this article was born January 7, 1952; he would have been in his early forties at the time of this release, not 55. Unless (and until) this can be documented unambiguously, WP:BLP compels its removal. To quote: we must get it right. This addition is not sufficiently documented for me to conclude that with confidence.  

If you read the documentation on the Bureau of Prisons web site, the age refers to the prisoners current age; not the age when he was released.  
 Granted, anon, the record is certainly about Reid Stowe. But what sort of story does this record support? The Bureau of Prisons itself asks us to note that an entry in the BOP locator database does not necessarily mean the person has",0

"""::(1) The french engines (40 HP) were superior, to those the Wright brothers claimed they built (less than 20 HP), being more powerful. (2) The brothers used the same catapult, the same extra boost, as in 1905 in all their witnessed flights performed in 1908. In conclusion more powerful engines were logically not needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Correct, they didn't """"need"""" more powerful engines in 1908, but were probably glad to have them. However, your conclusion that therefore their statements about their previous flights are """"their own fiction"""" is merely your own fanciful opinion, to which you're entitled, but which flies in the face of more than 100 years of published information and, yes, the WB own documentary proof, undisputed by all reputable historians. The 1-minute 45-second flight you mentioned was Wilbur's very first in France; about a month later he flew 90 minutes (after Orville had made hour-long flights in the U.S.).   
 I base all my affirmations on primary sources and not latter judgements. The so called reputed historians are just pro Wright Brothers propagandists who simply selected what they liked from primary sources and made up a nice story for the public, disregarding all evidence that throws serious doubts regarding the claimed 1903-1905 flights.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138   

Interestingly, the primary sources of which you're fond include voluminous amounts of documentation by the WB themselves of their work and their success. Try some affirmation based on that. You're right, though: propaganda does existnot in the writings of respected historians, but in misguided scribblings that sometimes show up on these pages.   

There is mention of the seven """"French"""" engines of 1908 here:  http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f260.image.r=wright.langEN. They are intended to be delivered as  """"seven perfect copies"""" of the model brought by the american aviator.   

 Strange picture - On Dec. 14, 1903, W. Wright flew with the two propellers on the left side of the plane, one of them not connected to the engine! 

The picture labeled LC-W86- 20, (see http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wri/item/2001696254/ ) from the Library of Congress, shows W. Wright just after he landed the plane on Dec. 14, 1903, damaging the front-rudder (the canard double wing). The flight was powered but the airplane landed below the altitude where it had taken off. The strange thing about this picture is that the plane (see one of the large size versions of the image) has both propellers on its left side, the leftmost propeller being not connected to the engine. There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity. 

""""There is simply no logical explanation about this oddity."""" Indeed, a perfect description of the posts above and below. I recommend an optometrist.   
Ok. It was my mistake. I was mislead by the optical illusion the image contains. I should have studied the photography more carefully.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.83.114.138

The source says """"By 1998, she decided to jack it in and go AWOL in New York. 'It was a lost year, and a lot of fun,"""" she says, unrepentant."""" Another source (Kot) says it wasn't a fun year but was depressing: """" 'It got bad in 1998,' Kim Deal says. 'I was pretty depressed before I came to Steve.' """" So, anyway, from these two quotes it may be hard to extrapolate that there definitely was no musical activity going on (plus, she may have been practicing the drums some that year, which could be argued as being """"musical activity"""").

"""""""Troll"""" here. Also in Good faith, my preferred compromise is to use both the principal terms in question: Country and constituent country for Scotland  & England, together with principality and province used for Wales and Northern Ireland respectively, as per the terminology used in BS ISO 3166-2:2007 (second edition). (The term constituent country being cited from the UK Government). These being as follows:
Scotland (Gaelic: Alba) is a country that occupies the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south with England. England (Cornish: Pow Sows) is a country that occupies most of the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares land borders to the north with Scotland and to the west with Wales. 
Wales (;Also spelled """"Gymru"""", """"Nghymru"""" or """"Chymru"""" in certain contexts, as Welsh is a language with initial mutations – see Welsh morphology. pronounced }) is a principality that occupies the largest western peninsula of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the east with England. Northern Ireland' (Irish: Tuaisceart Éireann, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann'') is a province that occupies the northeast of the island of Ireland. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland.
All of the above terms are verifiable and can be cited from reliable sources, which in addition to the ISO include: 
""""Scotland is a country"""" at Google: Hits include: www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk, www.historic-scotland.gov.uk, www.scotland.gov.uk, www.friendsofscotland.gov.uk

""""Principality of Wales"""" at Google: Hits include: www.royal.gov.uk, www.opsi.gov.uk, www.princeofwales.gov.uk, www.nationalarchives.gov.uk, www.assemblywales.org.
The above is not a complete list however the sources, as can be seen, are certainly reliable. Many argue that such terms lead to """"confusion"""" on the part of the reader. My response is that perhaps here is the best place to educate in order to avoid such confusion, it is, after all, an Encyclopaedia.

1. The statement that “Jehovah's Witnesses teach that blood is sacred and must not be eaten or transfused whole” is grossly misleading because all Jehovah’s Witnesses do not teaching this and your statement implies all of them do. Hence this statement of yours misrepresents. 

2. The statement “This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford” not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion. 

3. The statement “Beginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible” is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence. 

4. The statement “there is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions” is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah’s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion! 

5. The statement, “The non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine” is another horrible misconstruction. When it comes to the Watchtower organization’s blood doctrine, there is no other similar group, and you have not referenced one either. 

Your statement manifests a serious lack of qualification to address this subject. You manifest ignorance of the subject, and a willingness to edit despite that lack. Hence I have reverted to the verified introduction, which feeds nicely into the article as a whole.

I wasn't alleging that you'd requested that I be blocked.  I was warning you because if you delete my comments again, I'm going to request that you be blocked.  If you want, you can whine about that """"threat"""" to an administrator, but I'm pretty sure it's not grounds for blocking. -   

Please take the time to look at the policies regarding civil behavior. You comments on the BSG:Daylight part 2 talk page have been less than civil in their content. Per the WP:Civil policy comments such as these can and will be deleted without such actions being considered censorship or blanking. The people you have been engaging in have tried, repeatedly, to maintain a professional tone in the conversations, while you have not. We are not saying that your points are wrong, but how you are going about this is, all we are asking is for you to wait until the time that such assertions you are making are confirmed by a reliable, third party source that verifies what you believe to be true. 

Your comments on my page also confirm your inappropriate behavior and do nothing but harm yourself, so please assume good faith when dealing with others and scale back on the tone and content of your posts.  (blah blah) 

Wikipedia's policy on civility is meant to remove threats, profanity, and personal attacks.  None of that applies to my comments.  But there are some parts of Wikipedia's policy on civility that apply to you.  It says, among other things, """"to treat constructive criticism as an attack, is itself disruptive, and may result in warnings or even blocks... It is not normally appropriate to edit or remove another editor's comment.""""  Looks like that's another policy that you're breaking.  What is that now, four?  IAR, Use Common Sense, Discuss your concerns rather than engage in edit wars, and now the policy on Civility.  Are you going for a record?  I have repeatedly asked you to point out which part of my argument you disagree with.  You have failed to do so.  You're the problem here, not me. -   """,0

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1

This article reads more like a propaganda page than impartial information. It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horrod!) even further.

Although Ken Barnes is a fucking moron, we need more criticism to balance it out
Hi, As one of the primary authors of this page, I want to make it absolutely clear that I in no way agree with the ridiculous statements made in the citation I added from """"rock critic"""" Ken Barnes. Having contributed nothing to music himself, it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest Queen album. Nonetheless, we need criticism as well in order to better balance the article out. I have also added many wonderful things lately, such as Freddie's top listings in international polls, so don't worry too much. I also want to make it clear that, although I cite """"Rolling Stone"""" a lot, I basically consider it to be a magazine for people who are musically illiterate. Forgive me, Freddie!

 Regarding the Harvest page. 

Hello Moe Epsilon,

Wow, looks like you were very busy editing the """"Harvest page.

You referred edit readers to """"Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria items #3(a) and #8).""""  Thank you for the reference.

Regarding #3(a):  I agree that I went way beyond minimal use, although I will say that this was without knowing of the 10 non-free content rules.  My question is, does this mean that you needed to remove all album cover images and music samples?  When I added the images, I was using """"The Beatles"""" article as a reference.  Looking at it now, I see that """"The Beatles Discography"""" is without images, although the main article still contains music samples.  Does minimal use mean """"No use""""? (referring to there being no images at all on the Harvest page).  Why is showing album cover art excessive?  I have a feeling I'm asking a common question.

Regarding #8 (significance):  Is the discography considered a list?  I would assume so.  I guess this would be why no image- photo or song sample is allowed within it.  I would think this rule alone would suffice for removing all of the images I had put in the article, since they were all within the Discography section.  Would it be acceptable to create a separate section for music samples, as in the Beatles article?  If so, how many music samples would be allowed?  25?, as in that article?

I would really appreciate you responding to this post.  I would like to know what you think.  And I would also like to find out if any of the images/samples I uploaded are salvageable.  This would save me time in re-uploading if they are.

Thanks for your time and efforts in editing,

I have posted my comments indicating that I would be offline after them as a courtesy to others, who might wonder why I haven't replied to them quickly or might not be doing so at all.  Not everyone checks user and talk pages to see courtesy postings about online status, etc.  Sorry that you find my attempt to be courteous to other Wikipedians """"annoying"""".  In the past, you (and others) have not understand my comments (see the archives); as you (and others) seem to mistinterpret what I write and to read intentions in what I write that I do not have, I have suggested that you (and some of these others) not engage in these kinds of exchanges with me; I do not find them productive.
I am replying only out of courtesy and so that eventually this exchange can be archived by the automatic archiving bot.
There is no """"rule"""" or """"guideline"""" in Wikipedia that one must reply to every comment in one's user talk page or an article talk page.  Replying is up to one's own discretion and time constraints (""""schedule""""). There is no requirement that editors must spend their time editing Wikipedia; WP:POL states the opposite; that one should not be criticized for how one chooses to spend one's own time.  That is the prerogative of each of us.  How we express ourselves, as long as it is courteous, is also up to each of us.  If we want to take our time to criticize others, we need to keep in mind that we are doing so in public space and that our criticisms are being read by whoever logs on to that space.
From my own perspective, I find the comment posted above gratuitous and unnecessary.  Irrespective of that comment, I will continue to post what I consider a courtesy to others since that is how I intend it to be.  I do not intend to annoy anyone.  The guidelines for how to address other users are in Wikipedia:Etiquette, WP:NPA, and other places linked in WP:POL.  I try to follow these guidelines in what I post in Wikipedia. To assume otherwise is to violate WP:AGF.  I am posting this reply in good faith as well.   

To others who might be more interested than some in why I may not reply quickly or at all: I explain that in """"N.B."""", but not everyone consults a user's talk page when commenting in article talk pages, and so some may not see that explanation in """"N.B."""" above; therefore, I have mentioned that I would be offline in some of my recent comments in talk page article(s) that I have worked hard on in the past.  I will be back offline after this reply and will not see what anyone posts here until I return to check the functioning of the achiving bot (I don't know when that will be).  I have a massive amount of work to do offline over the next two weeks, which has been delayed in getting to me (thus I've been online occasionally in the past week from time to time), but I expect to be away from Wikipedia after this reply for indefinite and extended periods of time both during and after the next two weeks as well (on an extended """"wikibreak""""; please see the template notice above).

Lets REVIEW.
Since this grotesque offense started I have probably been solely and directly responsible for 85% of the material attempted to be posted. That 85% very quickly got chopped down to 4 sentences by half a dozen censors.  I decide to WIKI whallow again when the story goes super mainstream with CNN and even includes a """"response"""" from said obvious scumbags. NATURALLY it gets zapped again in seconds by a censor and NATURALLY its another (now 7 and counting) live wire that spends every waking hour removing and contributing nothing. 

I am stating as a fact that the entire WIKI premise has evolved into a joke and a 100% waste of time. WHY SHOULD I continue to fight the vast multitude badgehuters?
There ain't a single speck of ethics in ANY of the full time WIKI retards doing censorship as a career choice, probably because children aren't mature enough to learn what they are.

Now we have the single apparent speck of grey material in the form of ;wales telling me how vulgar and ban worthy I am for getting pissed off by the ultra sickening status quo.  From the heart SIR the singular badge I would like to receive from WIKI is the lifetime ban badge. That would be a worthy accomplishment from this fukkin disgrace.""",1

 """"SCIENTIFIC"""" SKEPTIC ???! 

He never went to college, so why this article calls him a scientific skeptic ? May be some people of his skeptic team are real scientifics, they sure got graded from some college, but this """"debunker"""" never went to any college ! so how can wikipedia call him a """"scientific""""? Do you know at least if he uses a scientific method for whatever he tries to debunk ?
People, he didn't finished high school !!!

http://www.sptimes.com/Floridian/41498/The__quack__hunter.html  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.224.230.5   

You can't even write proper English. What college did you go to?  What's up, Doc? 
Thanks for the link, though. That's a great article on the amazing one.   

 I think scientific skepticism is related to following the scientific method, not formal education h2g2bob (talk) 
For sure. The user 82.224.230.5 would likely know that. It's just trolling behavior.  What's up, Doc? 

I'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!
Oh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   
His IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. 
Back on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   

So according to you, it's enough to only """"suspect"""" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you """"suspect"""", how sure is that?! why didn't you even """"wonder"""", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don't you think ?!
I can't believe guys like you run wikipedia like kings of the info.. simply pitious.—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
I guess we should leave the 'no high-school' line in there.  It has nothing to do with 'scietific' vs 'non-scientific'.   His methods are unquestionably scientific, which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge.    
I added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   

 Works for me.  I'm guessing if he can teach college without a high-school degree, he could have attended college as well.  -)    

The IP again demonstrates that he's either a troll or an idiot, or both.  What's up, Doc? """,1

Your request for rollback

Hi Leszek Jańczuk.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!   ''''''  Let's talk about it! """,0

 discussions ongoing to establish conventions in some eastern civilizations 

hi
I observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for Japanese monarchs and royals. It seems that these weeks, there are attempts to standardize such issues at several spots. One example is whether to standardize Thai royal persons. Of course, Thai and Japanese are totally different, for example regarding the need of disambiguation etc, and should probably be as separate as Eastern are in relation to european royalty naming. I think Japanese naming and Thai naming could end up to different conventions, and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that. However, discussions may give new ideas and/or give reinforcement and more arguments for existing reasoning.

 User:Slrubenstein and other's falsifying and defamatory edits 

User:Slrubenstein who obviously does not like the word 'theory' (and didn't like the article from the beginning) has repeatedly edited the article adding falsifying terms like 'proposal' instead. Nowhere does Carotta """"propose"""" or """"claim"""" anything. Already in the Introit of his book Jesus was Caesar it is clearly stated that: To anticipate the result: Jesus proves to be Divus Iulius, the deified Caesar, passed down in tradition. The word he uses for this finding is 'disclosure'. So it is wrong to write he 'proposes' or 'claims'. 'Theory' was therefore the best compromise, but the respectable User:Slrubenstein and other distorters don't like that. It should be noted here that User:Slrubenstein has not bothered to explain and discuss on this talk page why he egomaniacally altered the status quo and threatened other users who maintained 'theory' with blockage which was later carried out. He has not answered the questions raised by someone above concerning his problems with this article either.

Now this excellent User:Slrubenstein has even gone so far as to """"protect"""" (i.e. block, prevent editing) the article altogether. I think everyone involved in this or just reading here should seriously ask themselves whether User:Slrubenstein who canvassed against the article, voted for stong delete and most emphatically defamed the author as """"crackpot"""" (this might be actionable), is the right person to further work on this article let alone be an admin in control of it.

User:Rbreen who also voted for strong delete and who has already been convicted of lying and destorting scholarly statements above, now thinks he is the appropriate authority to judge on Carotta's undeniable and never before denied classical scholarship. He obviously knows better than reputable scholars like Piñero, Canfora, Kavoukopoulos, Simon and others. Here's your typical Wikipedia editor.

Nothing new can be said of User:Iblardi either. He helps wherever he can to degrade the article and defame its subject.

User:EALacey is not even capable (or is he not willing?) to correctly translate the word """"Wissenschaftsparodie"""" into English. The correct translation is """"science parody"""". Another typical WP editor, it seems.

I don't even want to talk about User:carl.bunderson. Some quotes from the Gospel come to mind...

"- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

I did not set that the proportion justifies any killing. I am just interested in accentuate that for the whole WW II and every result of the hell in first palace responsible is Nazi Germany. There was no organized killing like concentrations lagers for civilians with purpose to murder etc at the time of expulsion. Also there would not be mob revenges and criminal activity out of government control. To clarify, even 3 years after war the government and country organization was very limited. Many people were demoralized by war and easily ready to revenge. When you take for consideration that every one of fifth Polish citizen was killed you can imagine how many people can be at end of his tether. Now I hear some impersonal blames without actual proofs. Uncertainly numbers of deaths and uncertain reasons of those. Feely it is juggle with numbers and accusations.

With accusation you must be very specific. I understand and accepted the consideration about what happen, but be specific. Be very specific, and do not forget that """"first thing must be put first"""". The story is regarding nations rather then individuals. In this case you judge Polish people etc. versus German people. One can picture a hell for innocents and compare it with crime against humanity. However imagine how can feel an individual in proportional situation. He was attacked, bitten almost killed. He lost his eye and arm. And now his neighbor says: the other guy lost his finger and got serious blow into his nose so you are equal.

The guy says, but I was attacked and I lost his arm and my eye. Never mine the neighbor says: this is a crime to hit somebody. _  I know that it is somewhat strange to compare nation to individuals, but for member of nation which lost so much is no acceptable to say about subject """"B"""" arrogantly forgetting about the subject """"A"""".

 I'm a little confused with the first statement you make. """"A gas is 'ideal' at sufficiently low pressure, p."""" I'm not arguing it but I feel like theres two ideas in there that are a little confusing... a gas can act any which way it wants to at any given ambient conditions, whether under those conditions it follows the model stated by the """"Ideal Gas"""" is a totally different thing. If we consider a """"gas"""" as one model and an """"Ideal Gas"""" as another then we can see where the two correlate (under what conditions they correlate). Whether they correlate more at """"sufficiently low pressure"""" is fine but thats not what I'm trying to explain in the article. The model for an """"Ideal Gas"""" has is own conditions and assumptions, thats the only thing I'm trying to display in the method of writing this article. Most people confuse the concept of an Ideal Gas and other simplifications of gases with the actual gas itself. Basically, I'm trying to have people say """"This gas behaves as an Ideal Gas under these conditions"""" instead of """"This gas is an Ideal Gas"""". I don't have any issue with your equations, I don't understand where that brings any more clarity to the statement.   

 Also, deviations from the """"Ideal Gas model"""" is not necessarily just phase-changes or chemical reactions.

Public Statement by Mark Bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues

You continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the Los Angeles Times. Why? Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, Mark Bellinghaus. I have never had a 'dispute' with Brandon James, since I have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by the OC Register. They also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. I will file a protest with Wikipedia, because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio's and Jeanne Carmen's.

Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle?!

Again, I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe. But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with.

The LA TIMES articles must be added to this article, and the CITIZEN is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour  posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of Kenneth Knoll, the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project. She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist.

Regarding the Brandon James claims which you willingly added. I have never spoken to Brandon James, ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. He followed me to every blog, every website. Attacked us, hidden behind monikers.

What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility.

It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. Who is behind this? We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action.

And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past.

It has also to do with cyber bullying, since I am being portrayed as a monster. I am being compared to Charles Manson and Berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in Malaysia. These people want me to go the Megan Meier way. They have already told me to kill myself. Not once, but twice. They have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone. At all. I have never extorted anyone. You people, hiding behind your funny and also so believable names, you know why you are doing this and why you are using Wikipedia, to destroy my name, completely. When I protested on the 45th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death, outside the chapel, I had my reason. Three people were threatened and harassed by the 'Monroe 6 Version 2007' gang of people who threatened me to 'come to my home, tie me on a chair, duct tape me and steal my collection. They were not shy to even include the AIDS infected blood by one of the members. One of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this Wikipedia moniker and we positively have received confirmation, that this female from Canada, a woman which I have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created, have thought out these many frauds, hoaxes, crimes.

I am asking you, that if you decide to keep this site up and going, NOT to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures. I never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history, but it did.

Success, so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters. Jealousy is one thing, but facts and achievements are another.

It is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that 'Mark Bellinghaus mentally ill' and other worse things, and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known Lori Drew manner. But it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website, which is nothing else than the revenge of a group",0

 charge of unethical conduct 
Jc37, at my talk page you wrote:
 ...Concerning ongoing disruption regarding the DRV of Erdros numbers. If you continue to disrupt Wikipedia, you may be blocked until the DRV discussion is closed. -  ...
I take it that your opinion is that I am (to some significant extent) disrupting Wikipedia. These points:

 Does the ongoing ANI (I haven't checked it yet) regarding canvassing, pertain? My sense is that the accusation there was satisfactorily answered, particularly by the opposing voters I was suppposed not to have notified. Will you be bringing a new ANI if I continue some particular activity (I'm not sure which, specifically), or will you block me summarily?
 I would appreciate it if you would point to specifics of what constitutes my """"ongoing disruption"""".
 I take it that you do not consider the subjects of my initial complaint (unilaterally overturning a conspicuous consensus) or the consequent rhetoric (persistant and repetitive spamming of """"reasons"""" which had all been addressed, persistant arguement ad hominem, and several insinuations that our responses are unethical or misleading, while the opposing rhetoric is self-evident) to be disruptive? Part of my defense to any accusation of campaigning would be to compile examples of the techniques of the opposition, so at least we could delineate what wiki considers unethical.

Thanks.

Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people.

My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim.

Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should.

Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are.

"It's clear that TheOldJacobite is doing nothing more than what he accuses others of... E.g. Not adhering to Wiki policy, constantly breaching anti-reversion rules and generally trolling to try and start editing wars with new editors. His latest revert - after admin decision - is clearly spiteful vandalism.
1) he left the article in an unreferenced state for months, and made no attempt to clear them up or remove them.
2) he took exception to an entry that was referenced properly, including a reference to the BBC - the BBC being a reference source for other items on this page, yet hypocrisy reared its head and TheOldJacobite failed to acknowledge, only finally accepting when having the nonsense of his illogical inconsistent application of policy pointed out.
2a) he also claimed that the newspaper source included wants notable enough despite having a readership level that warranted its own actual entry in Wikipedia - a newspaper that has been published for over 100 years.
3) he continually reverts the repair of the included entry, which meets ALL Wiki policies. These are reverted accordingly by me as they breach no rules but simply have some personal issue with TheOldJacobite. Maybe TheOldJacobite thinks he owns the page. Who knows what motive lies behind the behaviour?
4) He then summons up 'help' from a sock-buddy who also removes it and then threatens me with blocking because he can't gets his own way. That editor has no and rights so simply reverts to threats and bravado against a new user. it should be noted that Sjo has been previously warned on his page about treating new editors with contempt and warning him to stop simply removing new edits, so a behaviour pattern that is common to both of them.
5) TheOldJacobite then has me referred to admin for alleged vandalism - no action is taken. TheOldJacobite also tries to make me out as some sort of vandal purely because I have an IP rather than a full username...this is just childish diversion tactics,
6) TheOldJacobite requests the page is locked - no action is taken as admins clearly don't agree. If anything it should be locked against him reverting a totally acceptable entry.
7) Electric Wombat (admin) reviews the entry and determines it's good for inclusion and asks all to stop the edit war. I agree but would like to see an equal admonishment made to TheOldJacobite and Sjo for their arbitrary editing, non equitable application of policy and the gang-up bullying mentality against a new user. But, I won't hold my breath as I've seen all of TheOldJacobite's and Sjo's disciplinary record and it's clear that nothing really gets done about trolls like these so-called [editors] who simply delight on playing judge and jury and clearly think they own Wikipedia.
8) Despite Electric Wombat's decision of inclusion, TheOldJacobite again reverts the entry.  this is clearly against strict Wiki rules about reverting after an admin decision has been made. I wonder if ThOldJacobite will be blocked temporarily for sticking two fingers up at the admin team?
9) I have now applied the admin decision and reverted it back to what it was before TheOldJacobite vandalised it yet again.
10) I am wondering if Wikipedia is broken beyond repair when it allows personal and prejudicial views of editors like TheOldJacobite and Sjo to interfere with the mission statement of Wikipedia to create a globally-contributed knowledge base.",0

 Made in the USA? http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute.

Information needing to be inserted into the article
The translation needs to be continued, and the result wikified and styled. Taken from here. Moved here because Markstreet reverted the article for the 15th time, and I already reverted two times. 

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called """"Propaganda Wars Returns"""".

 Deletion of section on Possibility of Mars having enough water to support life 

I'd like to point out that BatteryIncluded has deleted this section. I won't try to argue with him because I have had a fruitless argument on the """"life on Mars"""" page on this very topic. He is convinced that the cosmic ray arguments that make dormant life impossible over hundreds of thousands of years periods in the surface of Mars also make it impossible for life to survive even if reproducing every year (although cosmic radiation levels on the surface are comparable to the interior of the ISS). I gave up arguing the point with him.

However I'd like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February (with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches) [The Present-Day Habitability of Mars 2013 - Program]

You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable. It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible. But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today. I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource. Please note I did not write this section myself, only added a couple of sentences to it.

 Belgaum, Mahwiki, et al 

Hi Blnguyen, how are you ? Comin to the point, I am quite dissapointed by the way you have handled the Belgaum issue. I know Mahawiki has sometimes violated some rules, but remember that he was provoked to do so. You gave a warning on Mahawiki's page but you didn't warn any of the Kannada editors. If you don't know, all four(?) of them, Sarvagnya, KNM, Naveenbm and Gnanapiti had questioned the verifiability of the reference Mahawiki had provided. But had anyone else questioned it ? Still, Mahawiki e-mailed the file to everyone, then he uploaded it. Tell me wasn't all this done in good faith. Then these guys """"trashed"""" his citation. What were you doing then ? You should've warned them. Mahawiki had to provide an online link to the article, which he has now provided. I think these same rules should apply to them as well. I question the verifiablity of Suryanath Kamat. Even if Suryanath Kamat may be a good writer (which I know he is not), but is what Kannambadi filling pages with, the same thing from the book. Kannambadi may be filling something else. And references from a single book could be WP:NEO. What about that ? And another thing, the way you replied on Kannambadi's page reeked of bias and partisan attitude. Really, I was never so dissapointed on Wikipedia. You know, when Mahawiki used yo get dissapointed, I would always tell him to keep faith in Wikipedia's admins. And I always believed the admins would never be prejudiced. But I've been extremely dissapointed. I had high hopes from you that you'll give justice. Rajyaमहाराष्ट्र """,0

"""Acupuncture HAS been proven effective in every single study ever conducted. The criticism that fanatic skeptics extremists have of it is that, while the difference between acupuncture and no treatment is very very large in every case, the difference between acupuncture and so-called """"sham"""" acupuncture is small, sometimes even clinically insignificant.

But this phenomenon makes total sense when we take into account the fact that this """"sham"""" acupuncture is not analogous to placebo at all, but in fact is strikingly similar to a very authentic traditional style of Japanese acupuncture (shallow needle insertion/non-penetration, alternate acupoint and meridian location, etc) that has been in common use for centuries are is still widely practiced to this very day.

The fact is, acupuncture is effective, and its silly to even try to test it against a placebo in the first place, because its not a pill or a drug or a substance that lends itself to such methodology. 

So what if some of acupuncture's effects originate in the mind? TCM theory itself states that, in therapy """"the mind leads the qi, the qi leads the blood"""", indeed predicting itself the main criticism that fanatic skeptic extremists have against it.

Its time to realise that Chinese Medicine is a valuable body of knowledge and lore, and to end the racism and xenophobia that insists that only Western culture is capable of developing an effective system of medicine. Afterall, if Chinese Medicine in so ineffective, how come the population of China is so much bigger than in Europe, where Western Medicine developed?

 Temporary massive removal of some legendary history 

There were quite a few paragraphs discussing the ancient origins of the Yadavs, but as I was picking my way through it, it appeared a well-nigh impenetrable mass of confusing data, and likely a lot of WP:Synthesis. Terms such as Yadava/Yadav, Ahir/Yadav, and Abhira/Ahir were frequently conflated, and it appeared at many (most?) times that info was included without regard for whether the cited author gave any indication that his topic involved the modern Yadav caste. The info is not """"lost"""", it is cleanly preserved in the History tab, and its removal noted in Edit Summary and here so that any inclined editor can go back through it and carefully select the appropriate portions to re-incorporate. I submit that any info not specifically related to the modern Yadav go into the appropriate other articles such as Yadava and Abhira, etc. and that only material clearly linking the modern Yadavs to those ancient roots be included here. Otherwise, lengthy explanations of past groups with no clear link to the present group constitutes Synthesis, as it implies/pre-supposes a factual linkage when one may not be specified.

Again, I'm not trying to permanently wipe out this info, I just think the section was very unwieldy and contentious, and rather than pick and chip at it, it's better to temporarily wipe the slate clean, and then mine the past drafts to incorporate any usable data.   """,0

Ok, then the section should be condensed to discuss the aspects in particular where D contributes to generic programming. If Dmeranda is correct in that """"static if"""" is a completely other take on generics then that point need to be discussed and exemplified, and I'm not certain if the factorial example is an adequate illustration of this since I failed to get that point. Also, the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added. Static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since C++0x will be equipped with a of_type (forgot what it is to be named) static operator and other languages have this facility too. Thus in short, the section should be condensed, sharpened to drive the relevant points home, and a better example should be found (invented?). I am doing a bold edit to test your reaction: since the """"D templates"""" section is in all a commentary on the """"C++ templates"""" section, I'm moving it to that section as a corollary.

Does anybody have any knowledge of how many túatha there were in Ireland? Obviously it was constantly changing, but does anyone know the average number through the period they existed? I remember hearing from school that there was about 100 túatha in Ireland in the middle ages. And if, as this article says, a Túath had about 10,000 people that would mean about 1 million on the whole island, which sounds about right from what I've heard of population estimates of the time.

{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her """"vanish"""" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid's. However, I sent an e-mail to ask her """"why... why.. why..""""... but now she is calling it """"obscene,"""" and offers to show it to any admin.

 Grace, The Chopper  
Since I have not seen much of a reference to this before, I thought it important to point out that Butch rides away on Zed's chopper named Grace. Grace is exactly what he has given Marcellus and, to a large degree, what Marcellus has given him after his rescue. This is in the original script and, I believe, another piece reinforcing the redemption theme so prevalent in this film. 
   Also it is interesting to note that Marcellus seems more interested in mercy and grace after, perhaps, and if,  he has received back his soul, which some allege was in the infamous briefcase. Ultimately, in the film, responding to grace becomes important when Jules redeems Ringo in the dinner and walks away from """"The Life"""". Vincent does not and ends up dead. Jules sees the miracle and grace and responds """"trying real hard, Ringo, to be the shepard"""".

Thanks so much for asking, . I know I often come off as a douche, and I've been fixing that, mainly by following your example. So just so i'm glasslike: I really am grateful for how you've treated me since November, in this,  my third attempt in 10 years, to withstand our """"battlefield""""-hardened Wikipedian culture. War is seductive. i was twice seduced, then repelled, by our """"war"""" games. This time, I'm here to stay, thanks to good Wikipedians like you. And i'm changing the way i play the game. Instead of rejoining our Competitive games (which only boys, mainly, love), from now on I'll be playing only Cooperative games, which both girls (and some boys), normally,  do enjoy. 

Now back to praising you: You could have simply done to me what too many other powerful Wikipedians do: with 2 clicks, undo the ~1 wo/man-week of work my friends and I invested into the Cooperation Index and 3d2do designs. Side note: we designed those mechanisms specifically for the inactive Community & Kindness projects that we adopted back in November. Our premise is this: systemic bias and other dysfunctions within the Wikipedia Community are but symptoms of diseases which have rendered our Community moribund for almost a decade. But we did agree that the Gender Gap among Wikipedians is the most shameful of these symptoms, so our first application of the Cooperative design is meant to end - and quickly - the gender bias among Wikipedians.

 also expressed some major concerns, in a note to me via the Gender Gap list. 

I've got two unmovable deadlines today in the extra-wiki world (so annoying, that) but I'll be back ASAY to address each of your points, at the Project's Talk page: Wikipedia Talk:WikiProject Countering systemic bias/Gender gap task force/3D2Do

Main points AGAINST this article (RfC)
Information that shows irregularities, tendentious editing, vandalism and POV on this article should written here:
I will start from what looks to be the main problem. 
Albanian nationalism refers to nationalism among Albanians. It should not necessarily show only claims made by certain circles as is done in this article. So the first sentence of the article: Albanian nationalism (also known as Albanianism[1][2][3][4][5] or Pan-Albanianism[6][7]) refers to nationalist Albanian ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania (1945-1991), its continuation into modern Albania, as well as its proliferation in Kosovo is a POV. Albanian nationalism does not refer only to ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania... it refers also to Albanian national uprising and Renaissance and Albanian national pride. 
Kosovo is a disputed matter and to say: """"The struggle for the liberation of Kosovo from Serb rule became the struggle for the recovery of the ancient land of'the Dardanians and thus a re-creation of their ancient kingdom"""" is a POV. Here are references that beg to differ One, Two, Three and Four. For more read Kosovo.

 The majority of economists do not follow Cagan´s 1956 definition of hyperinflation being 50% inflation per month for 12 months.  

I propose to remove the following sentence from the Definition sub-paragraph in the article: """"Economists usually follow Cagan’s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%."""" or replace it with: A handful of economists still follow Cagan´s descpription that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%. 

The generally accepted definition regarding hyperinflation is the IASB´s definition, namely, 100% cumulative inflation over three years. It is the definition followed by all accountants worldwide and by the far greater majority of economists. Only a small handful of economists follow Cagan´s definition. No government follows Cagan´s definition: thus, it is a fact that no macroeconomist advising any government follows Cagan´s definition.

The question whether Scientology is a religion cannot be answered, for there seem to be important, perhaps critically important, tenets of Scientology which the parties left without full examination.

And that is what you did. Not only are you a third party that seemingly agrees with his desicion, you also have passionatly defended my works against people like him on several occasions.

""" Bad crap ==

What bunch of crazies wanted connection to the Force to be mystical instead of genetic? Movies like these shouldn't be mystical! It's about the happenings in a fictional galaxy, not some weird spiritual garbage! The only time it should be spiritual is if it were referencing Christianity, and referencing it correctly at that!  01:48, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I, for one, am an atheist and don't believe in all that spiritual crap myself. However, I think that mysticism in stories makes them much, well… better. It also enhances the theme.   02:24, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

How does it do that?  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Scorpionman, what makes you think that a movie should only be spiritual if it references Christianity and not another religion? —  দ 07:34, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I suppose that depends on your point of view. I'm not relativistic, but when it comes to things like science fiction, there's no need for spiritual stuff.  15:26, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

In fact, I was disappointed when I learned that the Jedi use some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically. It would make more sense for me if they were just highly-trained concentrated people. -  14:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Jedi don't really use the midi-clorians. The midi-clorians just connect them to the Force, and the Force is what the Jedi use.   23:04, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)
By """"some mystical substance that can't be measured scientifically"""" I mean the Force. I'm quite disappointed by its very existence in Star Wars. -  06:46, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't really think it needs to reference ANY religion. Science fiction is science fiction! If you think it needs to reference Islam, that's your opinion.  03:30, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I don't think he ever mentioned Islam.   00:14, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)

I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring (I don't see any reference to Islam either), and I suppose this discussion isn't really relevant here anyway. But for the record, I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or already-existing religion, especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the """"humans"""" to us is obscure (since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy). I was responding to Scorpionman's odd (in my opinion) comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions. I personally think it's better to stay away from specific religions. —  দ 02:00, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I really would rather have it not reference spirituality, but my """"weird comment"""" stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view. I know not everybody agrees, but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific.  01:55, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Force is a power that can not easily be conceived, my young padawan. We must learn to harness its energies, let it flow through us. Only then can we become one with the Force.   02:13, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

Actually, that policy you cite basically just tells you to not revert banned editors if reverting would restore inappropriate content. If you do so, it's your responsibility. But the section above that talks about how helpful edits do not need to be reverted. Our one goal here is to build an encyclopedia. Reverting positive contributions to the encyclopedia just because a user is banned (or for any procedural reason, for that matter) is counterintuitive. So the general rule in these situations is to use common sense. If the banned user's edit is not helpful, revert. If it's obviously helpful, don't revert (or don't think you need to). If you're not really sure whether it's helpful, you should probably err on the side of caution and revert. But at the end of the day, blindly reverting any addition made by a banned user really doesn't help anyone, and whether to revert or not is left to your own discretion. In this case, there's clearly a disagreement, so I would recommend you explain exactly why you think their edits should remain, and discuss the issue with Hobartimus.

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither.

"hello..  i have not removed anything so it should all be there..i have only added =) regards 86.164.91.170  

I know that you only added things, but a lot of these things are details pertaining to other individuals who have their own wiki articles; so, once they are blue-linked to their own article, it is not necessary to give lengthy details of their life on someone else's article.  Remember, this is an encyclopedia, not a family saga.  Only details pertaining directly to the person in the title of the article are necessary, i.e. give the name of their children, but do not go on describing these children's love life, wedding ceremony etc.  Names of children are fine, but adding the name of the children of the children or children of their siblings leads to confusion.    
Instead of removing what you wrote, or even changing anything, I left hidden comments that you can read when the text shows when being edited.  If you care to read them, you will see what I am telling you.  Because, if you seriously want to work with other wikipedians, you have to follow certain rules, otherwise, you will get reversed, which I do not believe is what you want.

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN. And the best last closing words to a daft dustbin like you are - FISH OFF""",1

2) In the United States, if something is not specifically prohibited, then it is LEGAL.

Therefore, Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hahn is full of shit. Lane splitting is NOT a """"grey area."""" It is LEGAL, as described by the California Department of Motor Vehicles HERE

""""Motorcycles may travel faster than traffic during congested road conditions and can legally travel in the unused space between two lines of moving or stationary vehicles; this is commonly called """"lane splitting."""" """"

 Collegiality 

I defy anyone to find so much as an ounce of collegiality in yesterday's sham (and atrociously scripted) Bill of Attainder.

Thomas Jefferson was demonstrating collegial insight when he led the civilized world in abandoning Bill of Attainder, having recognized that it's a corrosive and corrupt tool of government that inevitably sinks any regime that comes to rely on it.  Shortly after the Founders outlawed Bill of Attainder in Article I of the US Constitution, the British followed suit, abandoning both Parliamentary Bill of Attainder and Monarchial Bill of Attainder.

It's disturbing to witness you and other misguided officials reintroducing this antiquated relic from the rubbish heap of political history into the current practices of Wikiversity.  Is this the kind of unwise practice you wish to teach to impressionable youth of the 21st Century?  Can you imagine what would happen to anyone who tried to adopt and employ that hoary and unsustainable practice in the real world of an authentic 21st Century learning organization?

 I'm sorry but you are factually WRONG.  As an Automotive Engineer, with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics, I can assure you that traction control and EDL are operate in two very different methods.  All traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the non-driven axle - any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will ONLY result in either (a) BOTH driven wheels on the same axle being braked, or (b) the engine ECU reducing engine output, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).  EDL does NOT compare differences between front and rear axles, it ONLY compares differences between the left and right wheels on the same axle, and brakes just ONE wheel, there is NO engine power intervention.  Whilst they are both """"add-on"""" functions of modern ESP systems, and use the same related hardware and electronics, the software control of the two different systems are distinctly separate, and help moderate/control different aspects of vehicle dynamics.  Don't forget, Wikipedia articles are not considered valid references for other Wikipedia articles, so if you have read something contrary on another Wiki article, it doesn't automatically mean it is correct!

New Pages update
Hey  ). A quick update on how things are going with the New Page Triage/New Pages Feed project. As the enwiki page notes, the project is divided into two chunks: the """"list view"""" (essentially an updated version of Special:NewPages) and the """"article view"""", a view you'll be presented with when you open up individual articles that contains a toolbar with lots of options to interact with the page - patrolling it, adding maintenance tags, nominating it for deletion, so on.

On the list view front, we're pretty much done! We tried deploying it to enwiki, in line with our Engagement Strategy on Wednesday, but ran into bugs and had to reschedule - the same happened on Thursday (. We've queued a new deployment for Monday PST, and hopefully that one will go better. If it does, the software will be ready to play around with and test by the following week! ).

On the article view front, the developers are doing some fantastic work designing the toolbar, which we're calling the """"curation bar""""; you can see a mockup here. A stripped-down version of this should be ready to deploy fairly soon after the list view is; I'm afraid I don't have precise dates yet. When I have more info, or can unleash everyone to test the list view, I'll let you know ). As always, any questions to the talkpage for the project or mine. Thanks!   """,0

 Legislation: European Union 

 The atricle claims: """"The European Union has ratified a law """"banning incitement to or denial of genocide"""" (both the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide)."""" The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide)."""" Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. 
 Let's have a look at the law itself. 
 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred
Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?   """,0

if i had smoked myself stupid and that was the deepest level i could insult you on, i would send fuck you emails to you all day long. i can take time out of my day, as much as i have better things to do, to give you shit because you are a pathetic, insecure, power hungry piece of shit, weilding you wikipedia administrator status like a trident against everyone that hates you, when really you more than likely were dropped as a child/feel unloved/were bullied in school/have a small dick and feel you have to be a complete social recluse and hide behind a screen.

i hope you do write back. please do. oh my, please write back. i would love to listen to your self-reichous shit, thinking you can make 'quirky' little quips and rhetorts to distance yourself from what people say about you, and feel you have re-established yourself as superior.

Here is the original Arabic text from Ibn Baz's official website 

""""وبلغ أمير الأحساء وتوابعها من بني خالد سليمان ابن عريعر الخالدي أمر الشيخ، وأنه يدعو إلى الله، وأنه يهدم القباب، وأنه يقيم الحدود، فعظم على هذا البدوي أمر الشيخ، لأن من عادة البادية -إلا من هدى الله- الإقدام على الظلم، وسفك الدماء، ونهب الأموال، وانتهاك الحرمات، فخاف أن هذا الشيخ يعظم أمره، ويزيل سلطان الأمير البدوي، فكتب إلى عثمان يتوعده، ويأمره أن يقتل هذا المطوع الذي عنده في العيينة، وقال: إن المطوع الذي عندكم بلغنا عنه كذا، وكذا!! فإما أن تقتله، وإما أن نقطع عنك خراجك الذي عندنا.!! وكان عنده للأمير عثمان خراج من الذهب، فعظم على عثمان أمر هذا الأمير، وخاف إن عصاه أن يقطع عنه خراجه أو يحاربه""""

And this is how it translates (punch it into an automatated translator or show it to a friend if you don't believe it):

""""And news of the Shaikh reached the emir of al-Ahsa and its dependencies from Bani Khalid, Sulaiman ibn 'Uray;ir al-Khaldi, and it came to his knowledge that he called to God, and that he brought down the domes, and that he instituted the hudud [punishments], and so the matter of the Shaikh disturbed this bedouin, for it is the habit of the bedouin - except those whom God has guided - to rush to commit injustice, bloodshed, expropriation, and violation of prohibitions, so he feared that the power of this Shaikh may increase and do away with the power of the bedouin prince.  And so he wrote to Uthman, threatening him, and ordered him that he must kill this mutawwa that is with him at 'Uyayna, and said: 'this mutawwa that is with you, such and such has come to our knowledge about him!!  Either you kill him, or we cut off the dividend that you have with us', for the emir Uthman had [an annual] dividend of gold in the custody of [al-Khaldi].""""

Thank you for taking my suggestion by coming here to Talk instead of just reverting without explanation. I have indeed reverted some changes by Jayjg.  However, these changes were not actually improvements.  Briefly:
 act-now.org is brought up as an example of how """"circumcision advocacy"""" is a term used by some advocates, whereas Jay's version makes it sound otherwise.  Regardless of the subjective quality of the web site, suppressing any mention of it would be POV, hence unacceptable.  WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 The definition of circumcision advocacy is accurate and not OR.  If you have some sort of specific complaints, I suggest altering the text instead of removing it.
 The article already mentions masturbation, you would like to omit the relevant and cited fact that masturbation is harmless and NOT prevented by circumcision.  Omiting this would be POV and WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 Actually, what's reintroduced is the history with regard to advocacy, which is entirely relevant.
In short, these deletions all serve to harm the neutrality and comprehensiveness of the article.  Therefore, I will be forced to continue restoring the text if you attempt to remove it without an acceptable explanation.  Your explanations thus far are not acceptable.

When they have no clue about the percentages they write Pashtu, Dari and Uzbaki are spoken by 90%. So if they know that immigrant Pashtuns are in majority, why don´t they give any numbers?

"""
Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1

 Australian federal election, 1901 

I thought you might like to know that the pendulum you added has had removal attempted. You may wish to contribute to talkpage discussion.   

 Jackie Trad 

Errr, well, it might be kind of skating close to original research, use of unreliable social media, etc... but she mentioned it was her birthday on 25 April twice on Twitter, and the Courier Mail said she was 40 on 7 April, so I kind of worked it out from that. I'll remove it if you're not comfortable with it, I'm happy to wait for a firm independent source such as a parliamentary bio.   

 Wow! 

You've done all the federal by-elections... love your work!   

I honestly never thought australian politics on wikipedia would develop to what it is today. It is now done federally, I wonder if wikipedia will ever reach the point of having an article for every state election, every state by-election, and every state MP.

 Melbourne state by-election, 2012 and Australian Christians 

I don't suppose you'd like to do the honours? )   

I'll try to get something of value on these guys together this weekend. I remember having an attempt back when they were first registered with the AEC, but I had a lot of difficulty working out exactly what their relationship with the CDP was (they seem to be what used to be the Victorian branch of the CDP, with possibly several others, still affiliated with them somehow). Hopefully there's some more info around now, especially with this by-election in the works. (I had a look at the by-election page and fixed up the candidates table a little - it was listing candidates of the Democrats, Secular Party and SEP, none of which are registered in Victoria. I have noticed, though, that Antony has started listing unregistered parties in much the same way as registered ones, so this will be worth keeping an eye on in the future.)   

Thanks!

Hello.  I am also someone concerned about the Zionists systematic holocaust of the Palestinian people.

As the people who control Wikipedia have systematically banned and blocked people like me and you every time we open our mouths, I am limited in what I can say here to you without being blocked.  I will suggest two things however.

2) Check out alternative wikis such as Red Wiki or Anarchopedia.  Spend some time writing and improving articles on them during them time when you are (or when you are not) blocked here.

Wikipedia was created by Larry Sanger, and has a lot of good ideas in its inception - a wiki encyclopedia under GPL license, the GFDL license etc.  Of course Larry Sanger is no longer with Wikipedia, and to avoid being banned I will avoid talking about what happened after that.  Suffice to say it is extremely ideological and people like you who don't support the Zionist bloodbath are persecuted.  It is also highly one-sided for other topics as well.  Too much so, it is inevitable that competitors to Wikipedia spring up, and I am sure they will be more successful.

"This is a very inaccurate and well poisoning characterization.  I am biologist with a strong background in philosophy, mainly focused on ethics but of course broadly on metaphysics, epistemology and political philosophy as well. At this point in my life I've gone back to school specifically to get a degree in philosophy and no longer even work as a scientist, so for you to cast aspersions of scientism is wholly unfounded. 

I don't think Dawkins should be called a philosopher for two reasons: 1. He is not referred to as such in philosophical publications, at least not enough that it is justifiable to call him a philosopher outright per WP:V, and 2. He does not work within the traditions of any established academic disciplines of philosophy.  That is, he does not attempt to deconstruct language so as to understand and analyze its meaning and to subsequently determine - through rigorous logic - the truth or falsity of propositions, as he would if he practiced analytical philosophy.  Nor does he fit into the traditions - however broad - of continental philosophy.

"""proposal by Coulliard 

I'm going on the soapbox for awhile, an uncomfortable position in a baseball game (sliding runners tend to knock it out from under you).  I want to explain my position without us getting personal.  If you take offense, apologies in advance.  And apologies for being so wordy.  Genetic defect.

I am a baseball researcher by hobby (computer programmer by trade), and I take everything about baseball's history seriously, especially the Negro Leagues, which have become my area of expertise.  Segregation in Baseball remains the absolute worst scar on its face.

In my opinion (emphasis on it being my opinion), Josh Gibson, Pete Hill, Satchel Paige, Bullet Rogan, Oscar Charleston, Andy Cooper, José Méndez, Cristobal Torrienté, and many others men would have easily been Hall of Famers long, long ago had it not been for segregation.  It's my belief that given current evidence Gibson wouldn't have hit much more than 500 or so home runs playing a full schedule, given the HR rates of the 30s and 40s (not nearly as high as today), given his truncated career (he died after his 17th season), and given the position he played (catchers just don't play full schedules because of the extreme wear and tear; on the other hand, he might have been converted into an outfielder or first baseman in an integrated Majors, and 600+ would have been a possibility.

Babe Ruth hit 714 Major League HRs; had he had to face Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, Satchel Paige, and other pitchers of color, his totals might have tailed down toward 650 or so, and that in a 22-year career compared to Gibson's 17.

What we know is that Gibson is credited with 115 verifiable HR in Negro League play, plus 44 in Mexican League play, which was a bit lower level competition than MLB.  Gibson hit .359 against Negro League competition, which would be second highest of all time (behind Cobb) had he done so in an integrated majors, and Cobb's .366 might have lost a few points as well had he had to face Negro pitchers like Lefty Cooper and Willie Foster.

The raw numbers are still small.  We can't do anything about that.  115 compares very badly to 714, much less 762.  But it's still important to know those numbers, because it's what he did against major league-level competition.  What he did against amateur and semi-pro competition in exhibition games is fun to know (if we truly did know), but it is not the true measure of his worth, and (IMO) it insults the man's memory to artificially pad his numbers.  Understanding that Babe Ruth hit HIS home runs in a league that played 154 games per season, that homers were easier to hit in Ruth's league than Gibson's (livelier baseballs in the AL), the relative numbers make Gibson look like Ruth's peer.

With few exceptions, there are no researchers who do not believe that Josh Gibson was one of the two or three best pure power hitters in the game, and no exceptions among serious Negro League researchers.  We can (and in fact should) report that there have been various reports of his accomplishments in earlier days, but these numbers, taken without any context present a superman as unbelievable as that X-Files episode (""""The Unnatural"""").

You have to trust that the reason for putting up Gibson's reduced stats has a noble purpose.  Telling people that Gibson hit 800+ HR and batted .384 against all levels of competition tells nothing really, because he could have in reality hit .200 with no HR against top-level Negro League teams, but fattened up by counting 1,000 games against Little League comptetition.  Telling them he hit .359 and had a home run every sixteen at bats in a career that included many games in Griffith Stadium tells them something of importance  it gives us an excellent clue as to how he would have hit in the Majors, had he been allowed to play.

The """"nearly 800"""" and """"962"""" numbers give us no way of being able to separate them and understand their meaning.  An official scorer counted every one of Babe Ruth's HR in his major league career, and we can go back to sources from that day and find it.  In Gibson's case, someone reported (sometimes months later) numbers that no one even at that time could verify, because a lot of the numbers were based on hearsay, and some were just plain made-up.  We can't tell how many he hit over a 150-foot fence against a 17-year-old kid with a 60 MPH fastball, because we can't separate them.

There's plenty of space on the internet for repeating urban legend as fact.  Wikipedia should not be one of them.

My proposal is that we rewrite the article to include the latest official numbers, and make sure it is understood why Gibson only managed to play 510 Negro League games in his career.  It will inclu",0

"Estee Lauder Contract and the phrase 'lesser capacity'
In 2001 Hurley was replaced as the face of Estee Lauder with Carolyn Murphy. However, Hurley stayed on with Estee Lauder and in doing so, ended the tradition of the company having a 'face'...after all, there were 2 faces. In the years following, Gwyneth Paltrow and Liya Kebede also joined the company as models, rounding out 4 faces. Currently, the company is fronted by Murphy, Hillary Rhoda, Paltrow and Hurley. The phrase 'lesser capacity' is misleading. Hurley models perfume, cosmetics and skincare for the company, something which Ms Murphy does not do (she does not model cosmetics), nor does Ms Paltrow (who does not model skincare). Only Ms Rhoda models all 3 as Ms Hurley does, but Ms Rhoda does not serve as the face of Estee Lauder's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign. Thus, it is not that Hurley works in a 'lesser' capacity, she simply works in a 'different' capacity, in actual fact, her workload has increased! Therefore, I am changing the phrase 'lesser' to my original edit that she 'remained with the company'.",0

Accuse me of bad faith again without a shred of evidence and i will strive to irritate you for every second until they block me.

I advice you do not respond to this with anything but an apology, I can't see it being pretty.

Name
""""Hyacinth,"""" customarily an English woman's name, is the English spelling of the generic name of the flower – which in German is spelled with a z. 

The subject was a German male. The subject's given and legal name was Hyazinth. German WP therefore uses Hyazinth. A newly published English-language history of WWII in the Baltics, Prit Buttar's detailed and thoroughly documented Between Giants: The Battle for the Baltics in World War II – published by UK-based Osprey – uses Hyazinth in every mention.  To persist in using Hyacinth for this person is an error, regardless of what past (mistaken) practice in English may have been.

POV Vandalism of Talk Page Comments
And why do we care about the Rapture Index?  (talk) 
It is possible that you don't, but it's a valid comment about possible informational inclusion. It is not a requirement that comments on Talk Pages be """"approved"""" by WP:POV editors with WP:OWN issues. 71.217.108.29  
And you ought not to accuse other editors of vandalism when they are not committing it. Please review what vandalism is and is not before making that accusation again.  (talk) 
Removing valid Talk Comments based on WP:POV bias is in fact vandalism and reverting it is not subject to 3R. You don't have to agree with everything you read on a Talk Page, but branding a comment you fundamentally disagree with as a """"troll"""" is both obnoxious, disingenuous, and simply wrong headed. Removing Talk Comments based on such flawed thinking is in fact vandalism. Are you a censor? Have a nice day. 71.217.108.29  
Since you refuse to refresh yourself on what is not vandalism, let me highlight some relevant policy: """"Edit warring is not vandalism and should not be dealt with as such."""" Or, """"Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism.""""

If you and another editor disagree on the appropriateness of a talk page suggestions, that is a content dispute and is not exempt from 3RR.  (talk)

Thus, as I said on Talk, I'm going to stick with helping Ling.Nut get his rewrite ready. I hope admins will continue to monitor the Six Day War article and protect it so that versions which have had gone through extensive discussion and consensus-forming processes are not simply reverted by these guys who refuse to discuss their objections/suggestions, etc. If you can do anything to help out the majority of editors who are reasonably working together to improve the article in this regard, I would appreciate it. And it's probably fair for me to speak for that majority in that regard. I trust my decision to let other editors whom I discuss the wording with actually implement the agreed version(s) will demonstrate my good faith to admins responsible for twice blocking me. I just want to see this article improved, including by keeping it in compliance with WP:NPOV. Thanks again. Cheers.",0

I can't believe that someone would perpetrate intentional vandalism on a site like this which really espouses the ideals of information sharing, open information exchange, and honor-system based knowledge transfer.

I don't take his vandalism on my work personally, but I do take offense to two things:
1) People like this undermine the spirit of something like Wikipedia, something that has the potential to change the way that people learn and to help everyone in society have access to all kinds of information, for free (not counting Internet access).
2) People like this have no respect for the sacrifices of our predecessors.  Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.  But people like Kanupur don't consider that, they only think of things selfishly.

Personally, I'm glad that he's been blocked, and I don't care if he gets in trouble at work because of his work's proxy being blocked.

I think the best (i.e. most altruistic) account for this phenomenon came from User:SlimVirgin, who suggested that longtime editors often grow to rely on the verbatim text of policies, because (for example) they find it useful to quote the text in disputes with newbies.

Good job on finding the link by Negash, I've seen it before and it's informative on the post-Aksumite and Zagwe period. It has nothing to do with Sheba, however, as that happened (if it even did) ca.1000-950 BC, not AD. The first one is rather odd because it's written by the same person who wrote Aksum. I can't really comment on it, but no one has ever said that D`mt was founded by Sabaeans, as it predates the Sabaean migration by a few centuries. I'm not sure why he assumes that all of the 500 BC inscriptions in Sabaean (does he mean script or language?) were made by Sabaeans either, since Ethiopians used the same script...

I take some exception to what you're saying, Xander, though I agree with it in bulk. While there is artistic licence for an heraldic artist to interpret the blazon broadly, I am not at all familiar with any convention allowing for adding embellishments. Can you please provide a reference for same? I am completely unaware of any convention which allows an heraldic artist to add elements that are not described in the blazon. The arms are the blazon, period, and nothing more or less. Beyond My Ken, perhaps a better way to explain this to you... you think the representation of the arms is what matters, yes? That is not in fact the case. Blazons are much more like recipes; Mrs Fields has a single recipe for e.g. their chocolate chip cookie. That is the important thing. Anyone, possessing the recipe, could make a reasonable facsimile thereof. So there's that.
However, this is all fairly abstruse heraldic knowledge which not a lot of people know, which gives us the problem you are having; you feel that presenting a given cookie as a Mrs Fields cookie is inappropriate unless it was actually made by Mrs Fields. In one sense, you're right, but you're only right out of totally understandable ignorance of how heraldry works. 
All that being said, it is true that there are 'official' coats of arms inasmuch as they are the ones approved for use by the holder of the arms. For example, the representation of the Arms of Canada currently in use has been personally approved by The Queen and is thus 'official' for government use.  
And with all of that being said: the reference in question does not support the adornments added to the image. It supports only the blazon, and any depiction which follows only the blazon is both heraldically correct and properly sourced. →  ₪

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,1

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8. At 22:09 he said he had already replied on that page. I replied at 22:10 saying he hasn't. At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly """"lying"""" at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied. Obviously, anyone who would look at the timings will take a second to figure out the truth.""""... Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8 at """"deeptrivia (talk) """", which I later on found and I replied to you at """"csssclll()"""", which you should be aware of because you replied at """"Thanks. deeptrivia (talk) """" but you don't mention this above!! ~Why don't you mention it?!

"For Daniel Case
Hi Daniel. The block is extremely odd. IMO, there is no real discussion of my activity in that AN thread in connection with a siteban. Jehochman, whom I have some history with, floated the idea of a siteban. Durova, who has been on my case steady for months on behalf of Cirt, generally bad-mouths me about abusive sockpuppetry, etc but does not ask for a siteban and a few admins float some ideas and come up with this account restriction idea by Ryulong. I agree to it. Then Ryulong backs away from his idea and from the whole thing. Blueboy, a new admin that improperly blocked me, an established editor, as his very first admin action three weeks ago and whom I blew up at and insulted decides to siteban me. He is supported by, guess who, Jehochman, Durova, and Athaenara, whom I also have history with and whose WP:RFA I made a bit difficult and embarrassing by bringing up her past actions with me. I can provide diffs for all of this but I want to show you one thread now, over at Wikinews. Durova comes over there to badmouth and lie about me and a neutral admin, luckily, takes the time to look at the diffs and see who is really harassing whom, here. I invite a neutral admin to do the same here. I have to run now. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. Thanks.",0

"I have no idea why you are posting the slang definitions of 'fuck'.  That is a total non-sequitur.  I have not seen anyone here assert that there aren't any ways of using 'fuck' that are slang.  The point was, and remains, that the standard use of the word 'fuck' as both a noun and a verb - the only ways that this word has been used in this entire discussion throughout this entire week up until your latest post - has been the standard definition that is widely understood and accepted as a normal word that is nowhere near slang.

You used this non-sequitur as your basis for reversion.  And to this day you are persisting in it.  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange.

As for the meta-discussion (the discussion about the discussion), Andy's revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted.  And where did he choose to raise that discussion?  Over on my User Talk page.  That is the most inappropriate place to have such a discussion.  I suggested to him that the discussion be moved here.  Instead he moved it to an Admin page where he called for me to be blocked.  Is that the action of anyone who wants rational discussion?  (This too are questions that I do not need anyone's answer to.)

As for your opinion that this issue is now resolved, I never shared any such view.  I added the 'See also' link as a step in the right direction.  Not as a cure.  I can't have stated that more clearly that I STILL see the article as broken.  My decision to leave here, for the time being, is because I see a critical mass of editors who are bent on keeping it broken (my opinion / my view).  It's fine if we agree to disagree, but that doesn't mean that the problem has magically gone away.",1

I have agreed not to mention others by name, but presumably the intelligent people in this group can see that I am both the primary international proponent for Open Source Intelligence, for 20 years, training and nurturing 7,500, and it is both lunacy and immaturity to contintually delete my constructive additions.  As one person notes on the history page, even through I am the author for several of the seminal works (no other person on the planet has written all the main english language handbooks, or the seminal articles in the mainstream published literature, or the two seminal works in TIME and Forbes web pages), this is solid constructivce information that should not be dismissed.

I ask that the person continually undoing my modest constructive work be himself blocked, and that my specific contributions be locked in so as to end this foolishness.  I spent five days developing this page a few years ago, and my work was destroyed by vandals from CIA, from one especially stupid journalist pretender, and from Wiki trolls who delight in deleting and do not have a clue about the actual subject matter.

The editing wars on this page, and the obvious bias inserted by CIA people who are in denial are what is responsible for the complete lack of interest in this page.  There are no fewer than NINETY government open source units around the world, and not a single one of them has bothered to enter information here because this page is regarded as being under the control of idiot Americans who are self-centered and care nothing about the real world.

 About .  

I already e-mailed this report on . I hope that someone of serious Wikipedia administrators will read this report and take serious steps in protecting the Wikipedia dignity

Hello,

I do understand that Wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia - but still some kind of very basic ethicalrules shall be applicable and obliging to all editors.I noticed that you have a person whose nick name is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab and whose number of edits goes over 60 per day very often spanning 5-11 hours dayly. This person is extremely agressive and intolerant and his/her edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people.

The best way to describe his/her behaviour and 'contributions' are given by a few people which can be summarised/quoted this way:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Spylab&oldid;=65026476

'I am probably from the USA and like to scrap others' contributions due to what I call """"factual correctness"""" - instead of knowing the facts and reporting them!'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab/User_talk:Spylab/archive3#What.27s_is_the_problem.3F.3F.3F

'I've noticed that you are editing someone's contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections - not reading references at all. Moreover, not reading the references nor providing your own - you are demanding new references.

Also, on January 12th you've made 65 edits on various articles in the span of more than 11 hours(merge, clean, copy, revert, etc). Don't you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day, hours and hours - practically not contributing anything serious to Wikipedia, only irritating many people this way???'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#About_Basic_Editorial_Ethics_Here

'When seeing that the existing edition of the Croatia section here, was reduced by User:Spylab to just 6 sentences out of which four were marked by the [citation needed] tag . Moreover, User:Spylab 'completed' his own 'editorial' work by adding {unreferenced|date=November 2006} and {weasel} tags on the top of this page!!! How a serious editor could tag/mark his own edits this way??? I reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction. Ultimately, the existing edits cannot be re-written or destroyed by just throwing claim 'replaced content with info from Neo-Nazism in Croatia because old version didn't focus on neo-Nazism' as he did.

All my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations - failed. Instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously, User:Spylab started throwing accusations 'last edit brok 3RR rule', 'you may be blocked' , 'sock-puppetry' etc. and selfpraising (User:Spylab) work as superior and claiming that I do not know what Neo-Nazism is. My attempt (questions) to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already - are removed from the talk page and when I've put back the deleted questions - User:Spylab ignored them completely.

I had impression that I have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here. Then, I went further and examined the whole User:Spylab editorial work and noticed that User:Spylab commited more than 500 changes within 10 days i.e. more than fifty edits per day - (November 28 - December 7 2006). In that period of time [User:Spylab] was busy by the Wikipedia editing on: November 29 - 9 hours, November 30 - 16 hours (63 edits!!!) , December 1 - 18 hours, December 2 - 7 hours, December 3 - 8 hours, December 4 - 21 hours, December 5 - 12 hours, December 6 - 17 hours, and December 7 - 8 hours.

The content of User:Spylab edits were - spelling check, version reverts, removal of links, copy-paste etc. So it is quite clearly that I had to deal with a mentally challenged person!!!

I just wonder how it is possible that a serious publisher could allow such access to the articles to a person like User:Spylab.' As per his/her own words, as an Neo-Nazism in Croatia section editor, Spylab publicly claims

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Page_protection_sought

'Actually, it's not complicated at all. The revert war has nothing to do with point of view, and I am not an expert on Croatia at all.'

My note - how then this person should edit some subject (s)he is not familirar with? Also, all references written in Croatian and given here in the Neo-Nazism in Croatia were removed. As per Spylab question here

"""

@AynHaylo The Aramean movement is based on our real heritage and history, which forms this strong foundation! Your invented """"Assyrian"""" ethnic identity has no foundation among the Syriac Christians (Suryoye) before the 19th century. Once again, the Syriac-Orthodox Church has clearly its roots in the Aramean nation and can prove an Aramean ethnic identity by its chronicles, which goes hundreds of years back even before the 20th century, whereas the """"Assyrian"""" Church of the East can't prove its Assyrian identity before the 19th century. BTW we are actually known as Süryaniler in Turkish and as Syrianin in Arabic, both words mean Syrians, but refer to the Aramaic-speaking Christians. In Arabic you have two words for Syrian, but with different meanings. Moreover, the bible clearly distinguish between Syrians (Arameans) and Assyrians. Syrian is the Greek word for Aramean and this word was adopted by the Arameans in their mother tongue and they have called themselves Suryoye since then. I don't care about what other people call us. Most Germans call oriental-looking persons Turks and every black person is just an African. What matters is what we call ourselves. We have always called ourselves Suryoye (Syrians) and our origin is Aramaic, not pseudo Assyrian.

"""==GA Reassessment==
:This discussion is transcluded from Talk:Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the reassessment.

 This article has been reviewed as part of Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force in an effort to ensure all listed Good articles continue to meet the Good article criteria. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed, listed below. I will check back in seven days. If these issues are addressed, the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted (such a decision may be challenged through WP:GAR). If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Feel free to drop a message on my talk page if you have any questions, and many thanks for all the hard work that has gone into this article thus far.
GA review (see here for criteria):

This article fails primarily on WP:LAYOUT; there are far to many embedded lists. The whole article is really just a collection of lists, with short sections of prose in between. Even the """"Programs"""" section is really little more than a list disguised as prose. There are also major problems with the referencing; there are a great number of dead links, which I have marked, and there's an unfortunate mix of inline references and external links in the text.

This is just the tip of the iceberg; I really don't think there is any way of saving this article without extensive work. Still, I will give it the normal week on hold, please contact me if anybody decides to rewrite it.   """,0

Totally, completely untrue.
If you examine the history and comments I've left, you'll see that the few people who are responsible for warring on my contributions have routinely vandalized and destroyed my legitimate contributions, while for the most part when I've reverted to my versions I've usually tried to respectfully retain the valuable additions and changes they've made.
Also, universally recongnized FACTS DO NOT require """"sourcing"""" and links. EVERYONE in New York State KNOWS as FACT that Deborah Glick favors big-government solutions, high-tax/high-spend policies, is against ALL citizens having ANY Self-Defense Rights involving gun ownership, believes that ONLY police should have all the guns, and that all her economic policies, which she CLAIMS are to """"help"""" the """"disadvantaged and poor"""", FLY IN THE FACE of accepted economic LAW.

Now, I guess you do have the temporary power to disable me, but you'll only be furthher discrediting YOURSELF. Even the Wikipedia Administrators who have complained to me about my reverts and re-edits have admitted and openly SAID that ANYONE has the right to edit ANY page, as long as they do not violate the 3-Revert-24 Rule; if you care, go back and review where they said that multiple times.

I have every right to edit any article at least once per day; and my posts consist mainly of ADDITIONS to articles, not deleting portions of other people's contributions. All of my contributions involve generally adding additional information, opposing viewpoints and the pewrspective of critics; ALl my opponents edits consist of deleting my contributions and trying to silence my participation here.

So go ahead, try totally freezing me. I will simply write to the Wikipedia headquarters and request that they review the official record, and your biased actions and statements. I will quickly be restored to my privileges, because you have no case, and you are just harrasing me because of whatever prejudices, bias or immature resentments you harbor.

I could never be humiliated or embarrassed by a small person like you; administrators of your ilk have already demonstrated that you would be better taking kindergarten and grammar school over again than trying to manage and lead other people who have achieved adulthood long ago.

Good luck, you'll need it after you keep embarrassing yourself all the way into a deep hole.

First Email and Agenda: WEEK 0

There will be scheduled meetings on every Tuesday at 14:00 in room 111. All group members are required to attend these meetings. Please remember that success of group projects highly depend upon productive group meetings, so please try to make every single one of them.
 
These meetings will start from next week, 6th October Tuesday. I would be heading the first meeting as the Chairperson and Sam would be the Secretory. The post of the chairperson and secretory would keep on rotating so that everyone is involved in this group project.
 
As discussed in today's meeting there are a few tasks that need to be addressed before the meeting on Tuesday, 6th October; which are as follows:
 
    *
      Setting up a Wiki Forum to have an effective group communication system and also providing easy access to the projectmaterial to all the group members. Tejal volunteered to set up the forum. All details of it will be passed on to all of you as soonas it is finished.
    *
      Coming up with conceptual design and ideas for the payload because as we all know payload is most important driver of thesatellite design, so ideally that would be the first step in our project.
    *
      Also please note down the email IDs of all the group members for future contact. And don't forget to buy a log book foryourselves.

If you have any further queries please don't hesitate to contact me.

 From WP:ANI 

Hi, all.  Now that I know that this discussion exists, I'd like to contribute.

I'll say three things briefly, then answer any questions.  First, I have no intention of making any phone calls in the future.  Second, I am absolutely certain that my actions in no way threatened the privacy of any editors and therefore was not an example of WP:OUT.  Third, please note the context of this accusation.   

 Ok, here's the context: your supporters feel that the phone call to someone's place of business does not belong in the RFC.  Fine then, based on the section of WP:NPA that I have quoted both in our discussion on my talkpage, and I believe I left it in the RFC, this is an issue that requires immediate intervention - if there is indeed action to be taken.  Indeed, when I became aware of the situation in the RFC, I should have brought it here myself.  You have had about a full day since the end of the interactions on my talkpage to reflect - based on the above, I'm not sure you used the time wisely. (talk→  ←track) 

A couple of weeks ago, I voluntarily revealed the fact that I did this research, while carefully avoiding any revelation of private information.  My motivation was to demonstrate that yet another checkuser conviction was mistaken.
Weeks passes without a whisper, until the now-departed User:Paularblaster digs it up to try to add substance to an unpersuasive RfC/CU that he and Schrandit launched.  There was no haste or cause for it, just an ax to grind.
Now, I said outright that I won't be doing this again, and whether or not you agree with the action, there was never any potential to harm anyone, much less an intent to do so.  All this talk about a """"chilling effect"""" is well-meaning but simply mistaken.  No matter how you add it up, the situation is one that requires calm reflection, not urgent action, because there's a risk of knee-jerk reaction without actually understanding what happened.
Now, I'm going to ask you, Bwilkins, the question you refused to answer before, and which you deleted from your talk page.  Bwilkins, how could my phone call have caused anyone to lose their job?   

(@ CarolineWH) Do you understand why we would be concerned with your off wiki sleuthing, and how that could have a chilling effect?  In other areas it would be bad enough, but considering that you are editing abortion-related articles (some of which likely document the murders or stalking of abortion providers) makes it more so.   

If there was ever any risk of private information being revealed, then I'd agree.  But there wasn't, so no, there is no chilling effect.  As for abortion, it's a red herring, as the two editors I researched had nothing to do with the issue.  I would add that this is not a matter of stalking someone I disagree with, but confirming that they were innocent of sockpuppetry.   

(ec):It was uncalled for sleuthing. You clearly indicate investigating the workplace of either Spotfixer or Phil Specter, even if it eventually didn't turn out to be their workplace. Had it happened to me, I would consider such intrusive investigations into my private life just to one-up me in a content dispute, harassment. Despite saying you won't make such phone calls in the future, I see no indication that you understand how serious and inappropriate it was.  

If I had determined that either of them were Spotfixer, I'd have bit my tongue to protect their privacy and allow RfCU to properly convinct them.  The scenario you described would indeed be chilling, but it has nothing to do with the reality of what I did.  Again, unless you can show how my actions were even potentially harmful, it's hard for me to consider them either serious or inappropriate.  I agreed not to do it again, but that doesn't mean that what I did was wrong.   

The """"I have no intention"""" phrase is what sports coaches famously say when asked about their interest in another coaching position...the day before the big announcement that they're changing jobs.  Ta",0

"""==Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians==

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

...

Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. 

While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.

Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states 

""""The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names""""  (i.e. not """"must"""" be) 

It further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...

Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).

Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...

Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)

I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)
  
I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)

Thanks in advance for all your help. """,0

While """"anyone can post as anyone"""" to Usenet, there is absolutely no reasonable doubt that the material quoted as Boyd was really written by Boyd.  Ten years later, Boyd has never denied it.  If he really didn't write that, why wouldn't he have said """"I didn't write this"""" rather than delete the quotes?  There are literally thousands of poker players who can verify receiving numerous emails from Boyd saying """"Your check is in the mail,"""" """"Don't worry, you WILL be paid"""" and the like.  And if you personally really believed this material wasn't written by Boyd, you would have said something during the 2006 discussion when you actually approved of its inclusion at the time.  That """"another person editing disagrees"""" isn't relevant, and it's clear there are lots of agendas involved, i.e. the user who initially removed this info is clearly Boyd because the username is the same as his livejournal, and the IP address that removed it later is probably him as well (since the edit also included """"Boyd is appealing the decision.""""

I have restated JHunterJ's version to use well-defined astronomical terms. JHunterJ's version was unclear because
 There is no official definition of """"zodiacal longitude"""".
 If we take """"zodiacal longitude"""" to mean celestial longitude, then every celestial object and constellation has a (range of) celestial longitude, so the statement becomes meaningless.
 As far as I can tell, modern astronomers no longer offer precise definitions of """"sign of the zodiac"""", and various media use the term in many different ways. Thus, the term is not well enough defined to decide of it is a mistake to describe Ophiuchus as the 13th sign of the zodiac.   """,0

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

 Hypocrisy 

I'm sick of this clique mentality. Rodhullandemu told me my proposed contribution to an article was worth """"fuck all"""". He also aggressively removed a legitimate talking point from the article's talk page as """"unsourced bollocks"""". My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article. It was cited (by me) and must have passed some scrutiny to remain in the article. Right?

Doubtless these inconvenient facts will do little to change your mind regarding my block. But at least show a little consistency with regards to personal attacks and use of profanities. The truth is, Rodhullandemu began all this anomosity between him and I and it all goes back to this. I'm sure this constitutes a personal attack, especially as I've since been vindicated regarding our feud (ie; I was 100% correct; he was not). So at least issue him with a warning regarding his aggressive conduct. That would be the civil thing to do.   """,1

"Yes, I meant that a 3+ size should accommodate most people. 

The latest change doesn't seem to make any difference in FF: at 4+, the letters overlap and are illegible. However, this may be due to limitations of Wikipedia, for the text is constrained into a fixed column that doesn't allow space for 4+. 3+ looks good, though, as it did before.  18:08, 2005 July 18 (UTC)",0

 Shrug. You can say that for any kingdom. The Germanic concept of a """"kingdom"""" is not a geographic area, it is a political area, defined by folks, not acres.  The area (often a Latin term) will always be an informal shorthand for a collection of dominions of barons owing allegiance to a king. """"East Franks"""" are a folk, """"Germany"""" is an area. """"Lombards"""" are a folk. """"Italy"""" is an area, etc. The """"Kingdom of Germany"""" refers to the collection of barons in the area that once constituted the lands of the East Franks and their subject tribes (Swabians, Bavarians, Saxons, Thuringians, etc.), which by the 10th-11th C. is now settled down into large duchies (the royal duchy of Franconia, plus Swabia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc.).  This specific collection of barons acclaim their king, who is crowned in Aachen (usually) by the Archbishop of Mainz (almost always).  This is the """"King of Germany"""", and the area these barons cover we can call the """"Kingdom of Germany"""".  There really is no term more convenient to call him or it.    """,0

The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .  You're the Aussie here, so I'm sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad (in this case both would have a long vowel, so try to listen for the quality of the vowels) or your noun with your loud.  This is just another little thing that distinguishes Aussie English from English English; that's all.",1

 Quebec registration plates prohibited in front? 

But... why? What bad would it do to put another plate in front? I don't understand.   
That is a question to ask the Québec government for their specific reasoning on that. I know for a fact safety is one reason some jurisdictions give. Example: A front plate might look """"real"""" and be confused for a real plate in other jurisdictions that have a front plate, you can take your pick - i'm just hypothesizing why. I do know that some vehicles in Québec, Semis (tractor trailers) are required to have a front plate, as the trailer hides the plate on the back of a Truck (tractor), for example. Like I said, just because it's not legal, it does not mean police enforce it, and just because it hasn't been enforced by some police does not mean it will not be by others.  """,0

Since the subject of links has been broached, I wonder if it wouldn't be good to try to resolve that category next, rather than item by item.

What should not be linked Plain English words:
crocodile
universe
mortality
theistic 
The time, space, causation, change and eternity articles do include sections on philosophy, but it is embarrassing that the only comment on Asian thought on these matters I found was one sentence in Causality. Consequently, a reader of this article would find little of help in those. Moreover, this article does not discuss the philosophy of time, space, causation, change or eternity in any significant detail. But, I would support linking to those articles once they include significant Asian philosophical content. But, even then, the link should be to the philosophy section, not to the top of the article. I didn't find anything on philosophy or religion in universe or mortality.
time
space
causation
change
eternity

What should be linked Major connections with the subject of another article that will help readers to understand the current article more fully:
Vishwanath
Kashi
Shiva
Ishwara
Manisha Panchakam But only if the article is written promptly.
Nrsimha
Kali
Laksmi 
Buddhism
South India Kashmir is linked, so South India or India should be linked as well (but only the first occurrence). The second is a redlink.

 Okay that makes sense. It can be assumed younger students are looking up butter and most likely the process in which it is made, leading to the vandalism. Thanks for the info!   

Butter alternatives
In response to 's request for justification on adding a section on butter alternatives, I added statements from and links to scientific studies talking about cardiovascular benefits of substituting other things for butter as well as some layman reports by health authorities which also have published on the concept of butter alternatives.

I integrated the health history into this new butter alternatives section as well. It might be the case that a """"butter alternatives"""" article should be created independently and that various articles should link to it, but even in that case, I feel that it is merited to summarize publications on this topic in this article. Thoughts? (talk) 

Where profits are involved one must be very careful about the claims by and on behalf of competing products. We should not be implying that one product needs to be replaced with another. Listing alternatives without saying why (in that part of the article) is thus a problem. There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors. We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable. It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues, so I'd suggest leaving the alternatives out.   
I hesitate to take your suggestion to leave the alternatives section out entirely but I would like to respond to your concerns in some way. My first thought would be that I could fork this into an article called Butter substitution, then have the list, a health discussion, and advice from organizations about doing the substitution.
About profits - there are areas on Wikipedia where there is risk of commercial intervention but I do not see unbranded food concepts as being particularly high risk at this time. I should mention that I am sharing this information on behalf of Consumer Reports, the United States equivalent of your Australian Choice (Australian consumer organisation). We publish food and health information from the US government and medical organizations, and I came to this butter article because of our own work. My organization does have a bias which says that people should consume less fat. I would like to make a health claim here that says that health organizations commonly give the advice that people should eat less butter. I cited the Cochrane Collaboration, Mayo Clinic, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and my own organization as saying this, but to go into more detail would be as you said, undue.
How would you feel about my forking this content into its own article, putting everything there, and then keeping a statement in this article which said something like """"Many health organizations advise that consumers should use less fats in their diet and cooking and eat less butter because of the cardiovascular problems caused by the fat in many people's diets. In addition to eating less butter, these organizations recommend replacing butter with butter substitutes which are purported to have fewer adverse effects."""" I would also look for information about the health benefits of butter, if I can find any sources. How does this strike you? (talk) 

Are there no conflicting opinions, even scientific ones? Are your """"proposed"""" butter alternatives 100% harmless for all people in all situations?

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son

 Very serious stuff

moonless night.

In the middle of the night, Watson is suddenly, and perhaps even indignantly
awakened, by the famed detective, who says to him, """"Watson, look up at the
night sky, and tell me what you deduce?"""" To which Watson, rubbing his eyes
for a moment, responds, saying, """"Well, let me see now. There are stars,
countless stars in the sky, and I can even see the Milky Way galaxy. And so,
if those stars that I can see clearly with the naked eye are themselves only
a small fraction of the total number of stars, then by logical deduction
there may be and likely are countless more that I cannot see. Now, if only a
small percentage of those stars were to have planets, and of those, if only
a small portion would to contain solar systems like our own, and of all of
THOSE stars, even if only a small portion were to contain planets similar to
ours, which have the capability to house life, and THEN IF, of all THOSE
living planets encircling THOSE stars, there were some, which were able to
house intelligent life, then I would be forced to conclude by logical
inference, that there may be countless stars, around which circle planets
just like ours housing intelligent sentient life forms, perhaps not unlike

 It uses the term """"settlements"""", thus ignoring Jewish population living in the land for centuries in cities like Jerusalem, Safed, and Tiberias.

After Davis sent Aquino his acceptance on March 17, 1973, he was presented with the honorary membership on April 13, 1973 by Aquino and Karla LaVey alone. ASL did not meet Davis until August 1973. Davis would later renounce Satanism, claiming later he was """"only into it for the chicks"""" and re-embraced Judaism. At a nationaly televised event honoring him a few weeks before he died, Davis said """"First of all, I want to thank Jesus for letting me be here tonight"""", completely shattering any doubt he had any lingering affinty to Satanism.

 Khalifa Ezzat sourcing 

AHLM13, I took a quick glance at this article and there are some sourcing problems that existed from before your edits.  You added a couple of sources in the education section and I appreciate that.  I removed an existing source () which is a blog and those rarely make good sources for Wikipedia.  See the WP:SPS page for blogs in general.  For material about a living person (often called WP:BLP here), blogs are even more restricted for their use - see the WP:BLPSPS page.  On top of that, going to that page gives an error message and there really doesn't look like that blog has anything.  I've removed the blog (used twice as a source).  Any chance you might know of a better source for what the blog was used for?  I think it was the last two sentences in the lead.  

I'd love to find some sourcing for the rest - where the articles were published and ISBN numbers for the translations and books would be awesome.  If you know of any, would you mind adding it?  Even just bare links or raw ISBN and I can clean it up later.   """,0

"THIS ARTICLE SHOULD BE DELETED!!! 

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own. 

Hey - I can play Hungarian Rhapsody... can I have a page???",1

"I think the discussion is perhaps obscuring the meaning of the concept of Taṇhā, which seems more like the impulse towards an object, rather than desire itself. Without desire, we would not eat or drink, and thus cease to be... without desire, as the Dalai Lama has said, there would be no idea of a path, or anyone trying to follow one (more abstract notions of there being no path aside). Taṇhā is therefore it's own thing, without specific translation in this context, but which we all struggle with every moment. That impulse to obtain or avoid which occurs, and which is attempted to be fulfilled blindly by those remaining in delusion. So although Taṇhā is linked with desire, it is not desire, nor the object of any desire.. it is that momentary impulse that drives us towards a desire. If we then form our intention around that desire, we make ourselves vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. If, on the other hand, we form intention based upon none of these things, and Taṇhā is acknowledged but not acted upon, then we are less vulnerable.",0

Your campaign for censorship got a strong head start. I dont blame you, as it's the guy below who is adding fuel to the fire. Friends? )  
With this unappologetic response, I think a longer ban is in order.  
Here's the one vying for head of the censorship department lately. Mind your own business a little more, Irpin.  
My dear friend. As it has been ruled by the courts, Freedom of Speech does not extend to protection of ethnic slurs and hate speech whose propagation brought about your ban. Besides, nothing could stop you from using one of your socks. So, you were not really censored. Last but not least, you could take your grievances to your talk page which was not protected. I think Renata was too lenient. But be sure that unless you change your behavior, the next block will be permanent.  

Insinuations and wishful thinking. The almighty King Solomon of Wikipedia, almost. I think people have been too lenient in scrutinizing your smear campaign. This is not Renata's fault, but a consequence of the lack of disciplinary action in your case (long overdue), an institution you so vehemently attack, counting on the ignorant unsuspicion of a few to abuse against other users. Soon, you wont be fooling anyone any longer, Irpin, so watch it (take my good-spirited advice).",0

Carlos Pellegrini, Santa Fe.

 Unneccessary reference 
Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article? It doesn't seem to add much to the article. Why's every article I look at have some reference to anime?

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other live-action medium? It's a part of popular culture, that's why. The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode.

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article. Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers.

If it is at the end, labeled, and sufficiently known information, why not have it?  

 why do sunflowers """"want"""" to follow the sun? 

what do they get out of it? is this known? guessed by relevant public work? I myself would even take a clue, here. (thats I really wanna get info on this) Bye and thanks.  

Heliotropic flowers are more prevalent among plants in alpine areas. The absorbed light makes the flowers warmer, which attracts more pollinating insects. http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1998.00336.x?cookieSet=1   May be the sunflower's heliotropism is a rudimentary feature from an alpine past?  

 Pizarro?

"Improvement needed 

While I've declined speedy deletion, I see two major areas that require improvement in the article.
Notability: While there are some assertions of significance, such as winning Seedcamp 2008, it's not entirely clear how major that competition is. Accordingly, there's no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. IMO, there's enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion A7; however, it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.
Reliable sourcing: Other than basekit's website, the only source provided is a review at Download Squad. It appears to be on par with Engadget in terms of reliability. Still, to build a robust article (and demonstrate general notability), citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.
My personal recommendation is that this article be given some time to incubate, but if it's not improved over the next few weeks, it is subject to being nominated for deletion. —'''''' (talk)",0

Hi Mel,

I fully agree with you. I am very new to wikipedia and I come from the blogging world where the writing style is more like personal essays. My mistakes on wikipedia are more out of habit than intentional (or with ulterior motives).

I would like to change these habits for sure. Can I expect some help from you (a teacher)? I would like to be a rather long term (serious) contributor to Wikipedia. Can I request you to tell me the kind of mistakes I made OR some tips for better wikipedia contribution (in terms of content and style)?

"Lol, you know what i meant. Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. 

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).",0

"I just mentioned the social conflict, because the contemporary crisis of Judaism was less a conflict between Orthodox and Reform movement, but a social gap between a ruling minority, consisting of families which had bound together religious authorities, academics and wealthy merchants through marriages, and a ruled majority in the Jewish communities and town ghettos whose poverty had dramatically increased. This is not only the social context of the conflicts between Maskilim and Orthodox Rabbis or Maskilim and Reform Rabbis, but also between Orthodox authorities and mystic movements like Hasidism. Hasidim in Galicia and Bukovina usually understood much better the problems of the poor population than any Maskilim among the West Yiddish Ashkenazim in Alsace or Western regions of Prussia. And Polish nationalists and among them, Polish Jews who lived in the larger Shtetl and visited the universities in Wilna, Warsaw, Cracow and Lemberg, formed a governing elite in the Sejm of Lemberg – the parlament of the crownland Galicia. The rural communities of Galicia was another “uncivilized” world for modern Jews in Vienna, Paris, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. Nachman Krochmal from Galicia as a student of Hegel must have appeared like a mooncalf. Their hopes focussed on a revolution in 1848 and it failed again.

 Moses Mendelssohn certainly belonged to the privileged minority of the Schutzjuden and his circle was the upper class of Prussia, but this does not mean that they were not disappointed about the backwards conditions in Prussia, whatever faith they had. Wealthy members like the brothers Humboldt or Polish aristocrats were very engaged to improve the social conditions. They founded universities, hospitals, they improved the working conditions of coal miners etc. If I compare them with wealthy people today in Germany, I can assure that they were much less ignorant. Otherwise they were also very intolerant people (especially around Fichte in Jena) like the demagogues who cause the hep hep progroms, so Hegel and his pupils had to go the ghetto to protect their inhabitants...

 But like David Friedländer Moses Mendelssohn’s social sphere had an impact on his concept of modern Judaism. As a pedagogue he wanted to teach Jewish children German, Hebrew and Greek, but he refused Yiddish as a corrupt dialect, which finally meant to refuse the prospering culture (literature and drama) of East Yiddish and the Ashkenazim world from Wilna to Bucarest. From the point of view of Alsatian Ashkenazim, Mendelssohn was admired as a radical philosopher of Haskalah, but the reason behind his radical attitude was the extreme pressure of assimilation, that the Jewish population had to suffer in Prussia. For this reason I was a little bit surprised about your categorization of Moses Mendelssohn as an Orthodox Jew. Conversion finally remained the main access into the ruling elite of Prussia which can be easily analyzed by the cynical statements of Heinrich Heine (especially his commentaries of the Pietist circles around the children and grandchildren: “He [Felix] is the grandson of the great philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, but he has nothing better to do than to set the lamb’s piss into music!”).

 I just collect here all these names and places, in order to demonstrate how open the category of Reform Judaism should be. And I still see no reason how to exclude Moses Mendelssohn.",0

 European Court of Human Rights's Decision is NOT a DEFAMATORY content 
You warned me to add """"defamatory content"""" in Talk:Armenian Genocide page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Armenian_Genocide). Notice that what I added is the DECISION OF EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS about Armenian """"Genocide"""". You CANNOT LABEL the decision of ECtHR as """"Defamatory Content"""". I will complain about you in related Wikipedia forums.
Notice and think twice whether the following content is defamatory:
 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

 Homosexuality 

Sorry to overrule a point, but there is no creditable way to suggest that Richard was not homosexual, despite the fact that  the category 'homosexual' did not exist in the middle ages.  He had sex with men, many times, and showed almost no interest in women.  Any respectable biography will say the same.  I felt it was important to make this point, and have changed a sentence or two to reflect this, but not made a large deal out of it  (for instance, not created a separate section). -Ft Louie

This is, IMO, a good point. There were a couple of lines devoted to this, as well as King Rick's inclusion in the GLBTQ article category, which were reverted by an anon as 'anon vandalism' (bizarre, no?). This should be restored, as there is at least excellent anecdotal evidence that Richard did indeed have a predominating interest in men.  16:39, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Again, Richard being a bisexual or gay, met a person in denial (or person in some other way disturbed by the fact that there have been non-heterosexuals also in history as well as there are today), who on 29.5.2005 vandalized this article by removals. This time, the vandal used the username Alphax. As above indicated, previous similar vandal attempts occurred in March 2005 and December 2004. Hopefully the vandal or vandals are enjoined from such future activity.  

Alphax wasn't vandalizing, don't be ridiculous. He was removing what appears to be extreme speculation, written in poor English. You make a number of claims that would benefit from a source - where does Richard confess to being homosexual? Note also that the IP you were using to add the material the first time also added similar nonsense to Humphrey and Isabella's articles, including """"Category:Faghags"""" to Isabella.  

I think you Adam should not be ridiculous. If you look carefully at the edit history of this article, you see that most of those texts were added by other editors months ago. And you have the basic reference: the biographer mentioned by that editor and listed in the references, obviously has answered your question. Please read it (I haven't - I trust on the previous editor - and I have not time to seek all books). 

As to Alphax, since that person clearly did not read this talk page, nor offered here the reasons for removal, before removals, it is regarded as act of vandalism.  

I removed the stuff because it was badly written, lacked references,, and was there was a link to a website that attempted to """"prove"""" the claims, also without references.  τεχ 08:10, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The problem with Richard's alleged homosexuality is that no one, not a single primary or secondary source, from Richard's time unti WWII, ever mentioned that Richard liked men; in fact, he was often cited for his abnormal lust for women.    The contrary view first appeared in """"The Plantagenets"""" by J.H. Harvey in 1949.  The theory remains highly controversial and, to be honest, viewed with some skepticism by the mainstream academic world.  It is a theory worth stating in the article, but it should be noted that there remains serious discussion on whether or not it's true.   

Well to be honest, you can simply remove that part entirely if you want. 62.78 seems to have moved on to other articles, and I know I've removed his nonsense from a number of other articles with no further reaction from him.  

I think one of the arguments for it is his lack of offspring, legitimate or otherwise: one illegitimate child, if I recall correctly. But a bout of mumps or other infection could have curtailed his fertility. Or perhaps he was the ungenerous sort who didn't acknowledge his illegitimate kids.  

The book Warriors of God is an excellent portrayal of King Richard's life, including his homosexual relationship with the King of France.

Listen, I don't believe that Greece is 98% Greek. I remember reading somewhere something about official statistics finding that 10% of the population of Greece do not hold Greek citizenship (i.e. are immigrants). Perhaps the 98% figure pertains to the remaining 90% which would be something like 88.2% of the total population. I think all this speculation qualifies as original research though. What is interesting is the question of """"what are the Roma (Gypsies/Τσιγγάνοι)?"""" According to the Greek government again, they number about 200,000 - are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure? According to official statistics again (1991 census), the Thrace minority is 0.98% of the total population at that time (about 28.8% of the total population of Thace at that time).

Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  """"Michael Moore said whatever"""".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been """"long accused"""" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean """"you can find it somewhere else"""", it means """"It's been or can be verified to be true"""".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.

Citing the opinions of these articles
Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this """"particularly notable because"""" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.
It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of """"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial"""", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's """"sourced"""". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.
So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.
Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).
This article is not notable to the subject matter.  It's very broad, compared to the narrowness of the article's subject (and, even narrower, it's notability and the cause of it).  The specific criticisms are not uncommon, and the article's themselves are not controversial.  They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse",0

"Letter to Jimbo Wales, Chairman Emeticus 

Dear Woolworths Foundation Board of Trustees,

As you requested, here are the faculty recommendations regarding the qualifications of the Umbridge Twins (Mike and SB_Dolores) to assume the duties of Headmaster here at Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy.

We were especially impressed by the recent production in which the impressionable young students of Woolworths School of Political Dramaturgy were inducted into the long-forgotten practice of employing Parliamentary Bill of Attainder.  The symbolic allusions to the Trial Scene from Alice in Wonderland was an especially brilliant maneuver.

We are confident that, with the Umbridge Twins in charge, our students will quickly learn all the well-known hoary practices from the rubbish heap of political history dating back to the Forgotten Realms of Hammurabi.

And, at the end of the term, all the students are cordially invited to Go Jump In the Lake.

 2013 Constitution 

The last sentence in the lead section says:
The elections were to be held under the new constitution which gave fairer rights to native Fijians, lowered the voting age to 18 and gave the right of multiple citizenship to Fijians for the first time.
I'm not sure what that's meant to refer to. (Particularly as it's unsourced.) In no sense were indigenous Fijians deprived of """"fair rights"""" prior to this Constitution. On the contrary, it's the Indo-Fijian minority which, from the late 80s to the mid-2000s (and arguably even before that) was subject to suspicion, discriminatory measures, and (very occasionally) racial violence. The stated reason for the 2006 coup was to remove an indigenous supremacist government, and put an end to racial politics and discrimination. I'm consequently removing that part of the sentence.

 Wondering If You Could Help... 

A couple of months ago, I created a page for the """"Original"""" Clark Sisters, an American close-harmony singing group from the 1930s and '40s, that was fairly well-known at the time.  As an announcer at a Jazz radio station, includng being the host of a """"Trad Jazz"""" show, I have some pretty extensive knowledge of this genre of music.  I properly referenced the article, and provided appropriate links to and from other related pages.

So, along comes this editor from the U.K., (""""Seddon""""), and marks the thing for """"speedy deletion"""".  Before I can even find out about it, the page is gone.  Then, when I try to ask him about it by posting on his talk page, he totally ignores me.  In the first place, I can't understand how a U.K. editor is even ALLOWED to edit a piece on U.S. music; secondly, if he is allowed, why is he allowed to place his questionable judgment above mine?  I am hoping that you can help me restore the page, so that I don't have to go to all the trouble of re-creating it, at a loss of several hours of my time.

 Some Issues (which I'm about to attempt to partially fix) 

1. The gold-leaf and quadrant electrometers are in a sense, also repulsion electrometers; they both work by measuring the repulsion of the same charge in one way or another.

2. My 1861 chem textbook uses the name """"quadrant electrometer"""" to describe a considerably simpler device than Kelvin invented. This device has an index which goes between 0 and 90 degrees (hence a quadrant) while Kelvin's device, while I don't fully understand it, had a drum split into quadrants. So I conclude that this is a coincidence. 

The best solution I can think of is to create a section of repulsion electrometers, and then describe the types individually in their own sections underneath, e.g. gold-leaf, Dellmann, Peltier, Bohnenberger. I will rename """"quadrant electrometer"""" to """"Kelvin's quadrant electrometer"""", and then put both his and the simpler one under """"repulsion electrometers"""".

Hopefully we can make this article clearer and neater.

"Proposal to delete part of page 

I think it would be reasonable to delete the text below:

There is  contemporary Rubaiyat is by the Iranian poet SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN called The Rubaiyat of SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN This Rubaiyat uses a number of patterns ie AABA, AAAA. This Rubaiyat uses erotic images to explore a range of mystical experiences. The use of erotic imagery was  commonly used by Sufis in Sufi poetry. SALAH AL-DIN IBN BIN DEEN is well within this Sufi tradition 

Thy red flushed lips pouting moon-flower
Clutch the bee in thy humid bower
Entangled deep he cries for more
As thy wines nectar on him shower

Oh cup bearer bring thy wine don’t refrain
Up lift   thy porphyry cup that I may drain 
My lips to thy lips jar
Lips on cups rim I sip again and   again

Up turn thy cup cup bearer turns
Thy wine hotter than Karkhiya burns
The wine drips fromst thy hole like molten glass
It rim froths with bubbles in my lips churns

The text above may or may not be truthful in its claims of the Persian poet's existence; in any case the poet and translator are both non-notable as far as I can tell; the poetry, furthermore, is quite bad (at least in English; I don't know about the putative Persian), and the explanatory sentences don't inspire confidence in the writer's clarity of thought. The use was commonly used? Sufis used this technique in Sufi poetry?

Why not delete it all? If we do include it, the passage we quote from the new Rubaiyat should not be three times longer than our quotation from Fitzgerald's/Omar's.

Your section on how to define area is as vague as most of your other articles. Area is easy to define: It is the product of two averages. Volume is not 'analogous' to area - whoever wrote this, needs to look up the word analogous. Volume is defined as the product of three averages. It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

"You got what had been coming to you. I hope that being a k3wL eleet nerd-o-pedia moderator has made your life hell.

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

You have it lucky in Itsly where you can watch it after work! Very upset about it but what are you gonna do. I could watch a re run of the game, but I can't quite ever get into it because I already know what happens, it's not fun to watch anymore with all suspense gone. (I like shouting at the TV screen) You probably know the feeling hahaha. Highlights are he best bet, but I know it doesn't show the full story of the game. So I can't banter much, but what a game it would have been I'm sure. I talked to my brother about it though, who had the luxury of watching the game and he said that if it wasn't for Buffon, it would be a whole different story. I love to see Buffon do well and still show people that despite his age he is still a top 3 goalkeeper at least! This just goes to show that you can't doubt a team's Champions League performance based on his they are doing in their domestic league. As a true fan, you are always rough on your team, but always stay by them through thick and thin. As you've said, this should be a great confidence boost for Juve and can hopefully channel it towards Serie A and further CL games, as there is still a long way to go!

Later, of course, the Turks conveniently took the role of the great enemies of Iran.  The extent of the influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own history as well as that of Iran.  The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the 'family of Afrasiyab' and so it is known in the Islamic history”(R.N.

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.

In his ludicrous block against me Jdorney wrote the following """"Regarding the Irish Republican pages, this user pushes a POV agenda talking up the IRA's military effectiveness. He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney 

The most serious aspect of this dispute, in my opinion, is edits such as [2]. Devin79 alters properly cited figures (from BBC News [3]) about the Provisional IRA's weapons arsenal. This change was made not only without providing a reference for the different numbers, but without changing the reference itself. So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5]. Not only has Devin79 not responded to attempts by myself and other editors to engage with him on the talk page [6], but he announced his intention to keep on reverting regardless [7]. Demiurge 

These accusations are completely false, and slanderous. Every single edit I have done of the PIRA article is based on a number of sources all of which have been cited in the article edits, and source page. Jdorney has infested this article with innacuracies and outright lies, due to his biasd view of the IRA. The edits I made are proven and the proof was cited again and again. I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored. Jdorney is an arrogant little punk, he has no idea what makes a good article and is an example of why Wikipedia is ridiculed in academic circles. I have access to several other IP addresses, and I will be using them to continue to edit the sad, amateurish work of this biased little loser. 

All of the above is also relevant to Jdorney's girlfriend SWATJester. SWATJester wouldn't know anything about the SAD if it slapped him upside the head. Having served 4 years as a Force Recon Marine, I would argue that I am far more knoweldgeable about this particular subject then some basement dweller who runs around calling himself """"SwatJester"""". I will also be editing his articles with various IP addresses. Both of these little dirtbags can go to hell.""",0

I don't condone insulting america, even if what htey say is true, just for our benefit. Canada's cities suffer from many of the same issues as most large american cities (Pollution, traffic, crime, unemployment, homelessness), and we can't and should not say """"ha ha! we're better than you because we don't have , and you do!"""", since most cities have them.

I don't try to bash my city or say it's a bad place, and contrary to how i feel, the city actually HAS been getting better in recent years (2003-now), despite crime rates increasing somewhat. Homelessness is down slightly, violent crime was down right up until our first-ever cop killing... our main problems are unemployment and petty theft/small crimes like robbery. our rape level is low, as is our murder rape. Windsor's main issues for crime are assaults, threats, and burglary/ Break-And-Enter (B&E;).

Now, one might get confused when they say """"but coonfox, you just said it has the highest crime rate!"""" True, we do per capita. We have more Break-And-Enters and convenience store robberies than any other city in canada when adjusted to population. Overall, though, Toronto, Ontario and Metro Detroit still beat us, since they have around 4 million people each (20x our population).

I can assure you that everything I put the Wikipedia galling article it is extensively peer-viewed and approved at Karlstad University, Sweden.

  

What is this """"live-chat service"""" that you speak of? I haven't ever heard of one. The proper way to discuss the templates is here on the talk page of the article. All three are applicable because: 1.  the English needs to be improved 2.  you have pretty much taken ownership of the article 3.  the article needs more wikilinks. Hope that explains it.

No suprise to me when the whole world is bullying and abusing people who have no means of fighting back, with the exeption of trying to make it so clear how horrific the discussion, realy can be. And it is to be hoped that somewhone in the crowd of onlookers finally realize the unreasonable and unjust in the many´s bullying against an unknowing victim or potential plaintiff.

Regarding your, , complaints quotation: """"you have pretty much taken ownership of the article 3."""" end quotation, I can only reply that there are several others who make contributions to the galling article and I only make sure it´s scientificly correct with regards to syntax and source. 
Some parts have I watched extra carefully, for example the pictures because I made them and it´s therefore easy for me to correct the content and syntax of the description. 
Other peaople are free to write any knew exiting findings and I will not change anything as long it´s has warranty.
A lot of the text have been changed by others over the years and is still present in the article so don´t blame me for something that clearly isn´t true.

"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

I want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. You are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who I look upon with the utmost hatred and condemnation. Your site is absolute crap because it is run by fools like Michael

Here is what I wish for you to edit... I know that tiger's have the title the world's biggest pure breed cat but they are only for maintaining heavy weight's more often, the lion still can reach any weight the tiger can, so in general what is being portrayed is false, you can put these weight's as they are scientifically factual...You can use just one if you may, but all show they are fact's...

I recommend that you drop this. You have been asked somewhat nicely twice by Admins to either take it to WP:SSP if you had any further suspicions. Now I am giving you pretty much a final warning. Accusing a new editor of being a sockpuppet breaks WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. There is methods to deal with sockpuppetry on WP. Use them. I also notice several comments aimed at trolling other users and soapboaxing. You are on the edge. Take care not to step over.  
1. I have not made and am not making any accusations of sockpuppetry. (Please don't confuse Domer48's wrongful and hysterical misunderstanding of my actual words with what I actually wrote.) Allegations of Sockpuppetry are WP's equivalent of a Witch hunt - and I refuse to participate in such silly nonsense.
My understanding is that neither Tyrenius nor yourself are acting as admins here unless you specifically state that you are so acting. If that is the case I will, of course, follow your advice - even though it seems perverse.
2. Had you not addressed specific remarks to me, I would have stayed silent - as you both should have done.
3. This is what I have already stated: """"I think it would be very helpful at this early stage for User:Brixton Busters to confirm or deny that he previously edited WP using different user names"""" (to his current """"new"""" user name of Brixton Busters) """" - it's entirely a matter for him whether he chooses to reveal those identities or not....""""

adding citations does make it easier if someone tries to slip a hoax in, particularly while quite a lot of the naems are redlinks.

 Dear DCstats and ERosa 

Starting a new section here because the preceding is hopelessly indented.

DCstats and ERosa, you are mistaken in your thinking. Jdannan and Avenue are quite correct. I know this might be very difficult for you to accept. You claim to have references supporting your interpretation. However, I think you are misinterpreting the statements from the textbooks you are reading. I can't speak for your """"petroleum industry statistican"""" friend. My guess is that you conveyed your misinterpretation of the situation to him/her. I have a ph.d. in mathematics and after reading this talk page and thinking I was almost losing my mind, I consulted with several other ph.d. mathematician and statistician friends of mine who confirmed that Jdannan and Avenue are indeed correct. And the interpretation given in the article is basically correct as well. In fact, it's the interpretation I've seen given in every stats book I've looked at.

Some references, since these seem to be very important to people:

""""Warning! There is much confusion about how to interpret a confidence interval. A confidence interval is not a probability statement about θ since θ is a fixed quantity, not a random variable."""" — Larry Wasserman, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, p. 92
""""CAUTION! A 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ. Remember, probability describes the likelihood of undetermined events. Therefore, it does not make sense to talk about the probability that the interval contains μ, since the population mean is a fixed value. Think of it this way: Suppose I flip a coin and obtain a head. If I ask you to determine the probability that the flip resulted in a head, it would not be 0.5, because the outcome has already been determined. Instead the probability is 0 or 1. Confidence intervals work the same way. Because μ is already determined, we do not say that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ."""" — Michael Sullivan III, Statistics: Informed Decisions Using Data, p. 453
""""The idea of interval estimation is complicated; an example is in order. Suppose that, for each λ, x is a real random variable normally distributed about λ with unit variance; then, as is very easy to see with the aid of a table of the normal distribution, if M(x) is taken to be the interval [x − 1.9600, x + 1.9600], then (1) P(λ in M(x) | λ) = α, where α is constant and almost equal to 0.95. It is usually thought necessary to warn the novice that such an equation as (1) does not concern the probability that a random variable λ lies in a fixed set M(x). Of course, λ is given and therefore not random in the context at hand; and given λ, α is the probability that M(x), which is a contraction of x, has as its value an interval that contains λ."""" — Leonard J. Savage, The Foundations of Statistics, p. 260

Your misunderstanding seems to be based on an inadequate grasp of a few facts:

 The population mean μ is a fixed constant, not a random variable.
 The endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables, not fixed constants.
 A statement about the level of confidence of a confidence interval is a probabilistic statement about the endpoints of the interval considered as random variables.

The issue about whether μ is """"known"""" or not is a complete red herring. What matters is that μ is fixed, not whether it's """"known"""". This also has absolutely nothing to do with probabilistic interpretations of quantum physics, good lord.

Let me go through an example which has the most simplifying assumptions. Suppose we have a normally distributed random variable X  on a population with mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 16, and suppose we select samples of size n = 100. Then the sample mean X-bar is a sampling distribution defined on the space of all possible samples of size 100, and it has mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ/sqrt(n) = 16/sqrt(100) = 16/10 = 1.6. A 95% confidence interval for μ based on this sampling is then given by (X-bar − zα/2*σ/sqrt(n), X-bar + zα/2*σ/sqrt(n)) = (X-bar − (1.96)*1.6, X-bar + (1.96)*1.6) = (X-bar − 3.136, X-bar + 3.136).

Now, note the following facts:

 The confidence interval is defined to be a random interval, i.e. the endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables defined in terms of the sample mean X-bar.
 We """"know"""" what the population mean μ is, and yet we wer",0

Happy to add some references and beef up the text when I get chance. But here's one quote from Ratzinger which comes directly before the quotre about it being a"""" fundamental threat to the church.""""

1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.

As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.  """,0

Thank you for weighing in.  I could not believe my eyes when I saw this article the other day.  It was the most obvious candidate for speedy deletion as an attack (I did not know one could ask for that at the time) that I have yet seen on WIkipedia.  I did a double take when I saw your comment about Pol Pot  i had missed that in the author's rant.  This attorney is hardly even infamous in his own community, let alone nationally or internationally.  A local newspaper reported about the sanction of the attorney for false advertising.  That is hardly the equivalent of Pol Pot or John Wayne Gacy.  This says volumes about the author, and nothing about the subject of the attack.  It disturbs me that this was even such a battle, and still is.  Never would I have dreamed someone would add such an article and then defend it so vigorously.",0

 Justanother 
Hey! I'm glad you wrote me. This guy is exactly the kind of person I do not like. I don't know where to begin describing everything that is wrong with him. I can see it in the replies to you as well. L.Ron's military career, if it is fabricated, is obviously worth discussing. I don't know why it would be fabricated, it wouldn't change my opinion of him or anythiing, so many times things aren't what they seem, but it's still worth looking into. It isn't 'he said, she said', it can be figured out what the truth is. And he says anything else is PR. This is what bugs me about justanother, he says things like they are fact. NO, it isn't just PR. It could be that he lied, it could be that there was a mistake, etc. That isn't PR.

Ok, now I'm reading the posts on yourpage. This is so hard to understand. You're not supposed to talk about Scientology with him, he says? """"Is that clear""""? See,he speaks to people with an air of superiority, like he is the voice of reason, of authority.""""And I have no doubt that you consider yourself the soul of equanimity and justice."""" COMPLETE PROJECTION. 

Whoa, I'm on the Barbara Schwarz page, he did this with me to. I don't understand those people who feel the need to inform you of obvious thigns you would never do like you need them to inform you otherwise you would do it. He did that to me at first when we were friendly regarding editing Scientology pages (telling me not to do this or that, which I would never have done). 

I think the good thing is that this is just the internet. If it were real life, we would be able to tell in a second what was up with this guy and we wouldn't apply him the same weight that we apply other people. I sometimes forget that when I use the net because you're not getting the feel of the person saying the weird thing. It used to bug me some of the things that critics of Scientology used to say, and then I saw photos and video of them, and it made sense. You could tell they weren't really there, so I wasn't upset anymore. I'd love to see what this guy looks like. I'd probably end up feeling sorry for him and have compassion and overlook all the incredibly rude traits he has. 

I don't know how to explain how things got bad between us. It's just his personality, who he is, and I disagree iwth it, find it incredibly rude and invalidating to other people, and just let him know. 

 You're on the Scientology's 'enemies' list? What happened? You defintely didn't imply anythiing negative about Scientology, it's all good. People I know make jokes about Scientology and it's totally fine. I know what I don't like and don't agree it and I'm not sensing any of that from you. Another thing about Anynobdoy, is he DOES seem like everything is pro-Scientology, no matter what, and I've noticed that with some Scientologists, but that's not me, and that's wrong. I dislike a lot of Scientologists I've met because I can tell the kind of people they are and the kinds of things that they would do or think, and I'm just not okay with that. Scientology isn't some group that you join and become this ideal Scientologist and just turn into that. It's like when I go to the gym. I don't adapt the feeling and personality of the gym and the people in the gym. I go there to work my body, to use it as a tool. I do the same thing with Scientology. I really hate when people do that because what starts happening is they start feeling like they're better than others because they """"act"""" more like an ideal Scientologist than people who aren't doing that, and all sorts of other things, which I think our friend here might've done.  )

 Useful Links for Recycled Lumber   Nina 

http://www.yankinsreclaimedwood.com/

 Diminishing returns from recycling? 

I propose that Steven Landsburg's arguments be either removed or shown to be refuted by the below logic. I personally think that the argument below, no matter how logical, would be too large to include. Similarly, Landsburg's arguments are provably illogical, and should not be included.

""""Economist Steven Landsburg has claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish the forests they own, large demands for paper lead to large forests. Conversely, reduced demand for paper leads to fewer """"farmed"""" forests.[34] Similar arguments were expressed in a 1995 article for The Free Market.[35]""""

If the variable of incentive to plant new trees is taken to be proportionate to the number of trees required for paper, as this scenario suggests, then the only way that the scenario is true is if it not only assumes that the paper companies are planting fewer trees than they cut, but that more trees are cut down than exist. 

The simplest refutation of the scenario is the model where lumber companies plant as many trees as they cut down. In this case, the number of trees not cut down, due to less paper being required, is immaterial, as the lumber companies would simply plant a number equal to what had been cut. In addition, more old trees would stand.

However, let us pursue the other, and in my opinion more likely, scenario. Companies cut down more trees than they plant. For the sake of simplicity, consider this hypothetical starting state. Forestry companies cut down half existing trees, and replant half of the difference between what stood and and what has been felled, or 25%, for a total of 75% of the original number, if not the original quality, the new trees being young growth. Let us say recycled paper amounts to one half of the trees cut, 12.5%, which would bring the total in terms of usable resource to 87.5%. If it were not added, the next cycle would see the 75% cut, literally, in half, for 37.5%; half is replanted, for a total of 56.25%. If it were added, the 87.5% would be halved to 43.75%, and the company replanting half of that would make a total of 65.625%, almost 10% more trees.

It does not matter whether the companies plant as many as were cut, if they are induced by the remaining forest amount, or a percentage, or induced by the paper supply, or a percentage; it always ends up with less forest cut down. If Landsburg is a notable economist, it speaks ill of economists; he has not exhibited logical reasoning or the capacity o",0

Thanks for restricting freedom of speech you dirty red. The US marines who fought for your country would be rolling in their graves. You make me sick. I was simply making the page """"Britain is Better Than America"""" to list valid and clearly logical points. I am disheartened to see that Wikipedia supports restricting freedom of speech and is going against its beliefs of all the information to everyone. Your country has been compared to the country of Germany when Hitler rose to power. Your country is filled with the scum of the earth.

 Ward Churchill is Not An Indian 
I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"Eichmann's."""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0

In all skins the three choices you mention are available, but the """"+"""" (or """"post a comment"""" - it's this in classic as well, which is the skin I usually use) doesn't exactly take you to the bottom - it's more like """"edit a section"""" but for creating a new section which when you hit submit is added to the bottom.

Biography and creativity
 
[edit] Early years
 
Viktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.
 
[edit] Star Factory
 
Alla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and added

In 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and """"Leila"""".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video.
 
[edit] """"Post-factory"""" life
 
[edit] 2005—2006
 
After the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song """"Leila"""" was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (""""Я просто сразу от тебя уйду"""") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (""""Хочешь, я тебе спою"""")
 
[edit] 2007
 
In the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».  A videoclip on this song was made in parallel with filming.
 
She was nominated in the autumn of 2007 as «Best performer» in the MTV Russia Music Awards. ((Fragment, as a result of having conceded to the singer MakSim.)) Also she was the winner channel Fashion TV award «fashion-singer of 2007».
 
In the beginning of the same year, Victoria took part in photos for April issue of magazine Playboy, which she has regretted.
 
In 2007 she also participated in the project Glacial Age. In this project she was """"star"""", being trained and supported by Alexei Yagudin — the first class figure skater. Victoria and Alexei reached the project ending, but did not reach prize-winning places.
 
With Alexei, Vika wrote a song """"Needle"""", of which there has been made a videoclip. There are rumours about a novel.  To date, theya re only rumours.
 
Also in 2007 Victoria tried out in film. She appeared in a a small, bit part, in a teleserial «Happy Together», where Vika has played herself; She has also has voiced the main heroine Panti in an animation «Noev an ark» with the Russian version of a Gloria Gaynor’s song «I Will Survive».
 
[edit] 2008— present
 
On 6 March 2008 She released a debut album """"Needle"""". The album became «the collection of hits of the singer» as it was the first album for 3 years of work. Now Victoria begins work on the second album.

The inline citations are not really required if the website link at the end leads to the same info. The backscatter sections read more like instructional material, and are not particularly encyclopedic in tone. I do not believe that those sections should be kept in the article. Finally, the external links section should have one link to the main website.

Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

 """"Right to be forgotten"""" 

I think that the present conflict between Google and the Spanish Data Protection Agency bears watching.  The Spanish are seeking input from the EU, and could in the worst case become a model for EU countries.  Many of the 90 people who the Spanish want censored from the Google results would not be affected the same way by Wikipedia - hopefully people would add information about a lawsuit's dismissal, and a principal known only for public urination wouldn't be notable.  But Wikipedians might believe that someone who murders but gets off on temporary insanity is notable, and shouldn't be allowed to move on with his life until the victim moves on with his.

Wikipedia might be a natural ally for Google, since balanced articles here, appearing high in the rankings, can offset the impact of raw hits on news headlines.  And Google's deletions, if forced, would hinder our research.  In the end, the way to deal with petty prejudice by human resources functionaries is to fight for equal and widespread access to employment, rather than to impose censorship.  The latter approach only helps those who have actually done things wrong, not those who simply have an appearance that bigots don't like.   """,0

"Ah...so you're an administrator (maybe). Pardon me, then - you were apparently only trying to do your job. 

I was thrown off by the fact that you voted, non-neutrally and without verification for your editorial remarks. Surely an administrator doesn't want to be caught violating Wikipedia policy? I guess I'm a bit confused. 

But may I ask you a question? Have you cited anyone else for incivility? A simple yes or no would do - I'm not interested in whom else you cited. I'd just like to ascertain that you're being balanced in your assessments, that's all. You've got a very bad show going on here, a regular grabastic kangaroo court, and in no way am I the cause of it.

We can all tailor hypotheticals to fit our arguments, but they are irrelevant, practical application is the real test. In regards to Islam, it is a vicious and wicked faith, and it is against all bounds of human logic, in Islam, a woman bearing her hair is haram, but her husband beating her up is halal, does this not defy human logic? """"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"""" is the oldest part of morality, it is a code to live by, if it is removed then simply in moral terms you can do what you like to people.

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her. I got aggressive only after her rude, holier-than-thou tirade started.

I've had to play this stupid game before with other idiots around here, usually they just go away, but she wanted to continue talking shit.

Perhaps I seem to be repeating myself as you are repeatedly ignoring what I'm writing. The tables are unclear as the order of the product is unclear from them. E.g. the top-right corner of the first table is e6. But does that mean e1 × e7 = e6 or e7 × e1 = e6 ? It would not matter if the product is commutative but as it's not the tables are ambiguous. That is why tables are a very poor way to show the product, and probably why none of the sources use them.
And again please read MOS:LEAD in paticular the section on providing an accessible overview. Or look at the articles already mentioned, Special relativity and Cross product.

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!""",1

1- i am blocked to edit in this page. All i write, is deleted by mr. BillCJ. Sistematically.

2-Then i write in the talk up to 30kb, then Akradecki moves the article to a draft.

3-NOBODY cares to work in this page, except me. I ask for help to other contributors, the same that 'proposed the sandboxes' and so on to confine me.

4-After several weeks have enough to be apartheid-ized and so, i start to write it in the main page.  

5-Bzuk, one of the guy with i have major problems and a arbcom case opened, arrives swiftly and posed a lot of tags about the horrendous contributions

6-Ahunt 'corrected them'

7-I notice that that process has cutted out several important parts of the article i posted 

8-I add them, WITHOUT revert all the work he did. 

9-Ahunt arrives and revert my adds

10-I protest with this issue 

11-Ahunt replies me that if i don't want to be edited my contributions, then i do not post them

12-I note that this is NOT a reply on my points, but rather a bit trolling statement: he says that since everyone can edit, so every change, deletion and worsening article is accepted, while when i make edits on some articles i am reverted at will. 

13-BillCJ arrives to Akra talk page and complaint: i offensed Ahunt!

14-5 minuts after Akra blocked me for a week

15-I request a unblock

16-John swiftly denies it.

17-Since i am blocked for a week, and in spite to 'not attack who is at ground' this night: Bzuk and Bill made more accusations on me in the Arbcom page. 

18-FInally Ahunt cames in the page i wrote F-4 in world service, 60kb long and start to complain this.

Obviously i cannot reply in any sense, and i cannot oppose to the 'consense'. Who cares if i am provocked, who cares if i wrote 60 kb page for the sake of knowledge in wiki.en? 

That matter is strike me and my work: and you simply says that 'not matter'? When these other gentlemens will responsable of their actions? When it will be clear that who provockes is not better than who 'answer' to provocations?

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",1

Pressure

A source is being mis-used where there is a statement that says the fringe media pressured these various agencies to respond.   

Entry says:Because of the popularity of the conspiracy theory, official agencies have received many enquiries from people demanding an explanation.[1][3]

I think it is dubious and the source does not mention popularity as the cause for this pressure nor do these vague inquires seem to be specific incident complaints of the type these agencies investigate. This would require times, dates, locations, to proof of an incident much less any """"suspect"""" worthy of investigation by the responding agencies.  One caveat is that these are alleged to be CBW issues and an environmental agency, space agency, or weather agency, or FAA would not even be the primary agency to respond, In my opinion, they might be notified or have something forwarded to them if only to answer questions that they might receive.  After enough questions they made fact sheets.  Were the fact sheets released solely because the theory is popular or because of the exasperating questions?  It should worded better. example below:.  Not sure what the dead link said. It's not verifiable.

"Selected articles on Portal:F1 

Hello again.

I dropped notes round a while back to those who have listed themselves at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One to ask for suggestions for selected articles on portal:Formula One. There was a pretty good response, both in terms of how it might work and of articles suggested. Damon Hill came out with the most support and was brought up to Good Article standard after a lot of work by Skully Collins before going on as the F1 portal selected article a couple of weeks ago. It is now at Featured Article Candidates as a Featured Article candidate (why not drop by and see if you can help polish it further?).

Several people who responded to the original request suggested that a monthly or bi-weekly 'Selected Article' could act as a catalyst for an improvement drive to get more articles up to a higher standard. Although it wasn't quite what I had in mind when I started, this seemed to work pretty well for the Damon Hill article, so I've drafted up a process for doing this more regularly. See Portal_talk:Formula_One/Management_of_selected_articles for details. Essentially the suggestion is that we vote for an article to improve every couple of weeks and at the end of the improvement process the article goes on the portal as the new 'Selected Article'. I'd be grateful for any comments on how this might work - I'm sure some of you are more familiar with things 'Wiki' than me - as well as your votes for the next candidate (by 16 July).

You may also want to help with the article Gilles Villeneuve, which was the next most popular after Damon Hill. The idea is to try and get it up to GA standard by 16 July and then put it on the portal as the 'Selected Article'. I hope you can help!",0

Five of the statements are simply wrong. Mary Baker Eddy was an emphatic and orthodox believer in the virgin birth. She certainly believed in the resurrection and the atonement (there is a chapter on """"Atonement and Eucharist"""" in Science and Health). Heaven and hell are defined in the Glossary of the textbook, though they are understood differently in Christian Science than in mainstream Christianity. (It is true that CS does not adhere to the concept of miracles, seeing healing as a result of laws of nature that are not widely understood.) This section is so wrong that it really needs to be corrected in the interest of the accuracy of the article, whatever one might think of CS per se. I don't have time to root out academic sources on this so I suggest that it simply be removed. The over-riding concern is, surely to give an accurate picture of the topic.

 Questionable """"Unresolved Disruptive Technologies"""" 

Some of the examples of """"unresolved"""" technologies promoted as disruptive cannot honestly be considered """"unresolved"""".  The most glaring of these is """"e-commerce vs. physical shops"""".  It is absolutely clear that both e-commerce and physical shops are completely entrenched in their own respective niches, and while there is a lot of competition between them in some areas, the idea that either one could entirely supplant and eliminate the other in the forseeable future* is lunacy.  Similar arguments apply to """"free / open-source vs. proprietary software"""" and """"Internet Video on Demand and IPTV vs. Advertising supported broadcast and cable television"""".

The examples of """"Music downloads and File sharing vs. compact discs"""", """"ebooks vs. paper books"""", and """"VoIP (and VoIP over 802.11) vs. traditional telephone and mobile phone service"""" are much better examples of """"unresolved"""" potentially disruptive technologies.

There is no need for a point-by-point evaluation of all claims Boswell makes regarding Sergius and Bacchus (additionally, not all those claims are disputed; for instance that Sergius and Bacchus were the most popular example of paired saints). Indeed, WP:FRINGE specifically says not to do this. It is enough to indicate that many other historians have rejected it. t/c",0

"""== Tizoc Ceballos, Composer (b.1979) Los Angeles, Ca ==

 Biography 
Tizoc is a notable American Composer of New Musichttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_20th_century_classical_composers#1970s.  At a very early age he began studying piano, and in Middle School began taking trumpet lessons at the Los Angeles Music and Arts School. There he also began taking Mariachi lessons and by age 16 was fully immersed into the Mariachi world.  Today Tizoc is privileged to have had the opportunity to play along side of some of the most talented Mariachi musicians in the world and enjoys sharing his passion for Mariachi music through teaching and performing.

While completing his undergraduate work at Chapman University, through the support of professors and his wife, Tizoc realized a passion for writing music. Tizoc’s new found excitement for composition and new music led him to participate in Chapman’s New Music and Percussion Ensembles where he began learning percussion, and expanding his exposure to 21st century music. By his second year at Chapman, Tizoc gained admission into the composition program and began studying with composers Sean Heim and Shaun Naidoo. Compositionally, Tizoc is influenced by many different kinds of music, and aspires to use music as a medium to express some of our inner most emotions and states of mind.  His music has been performances by Chapman Universities Chamber Orchestra, New Music Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble as well as The California Ear Unit.

 Works 
Desidero Innocentia (2003) –Orchestra

Alone- Tenor and Piano

The Demon Within (2004) - Tape (electronic)
The Demon Within is a full electronic piece composed using sound samples processed through Adobe Audition. The piece centers on the idea of a person running from their demons. This piece is the story of the realization that our demons are a part of us, and inside us. They cannot be escaped.

Tu se Morta (2005) -Solo Cello and Tape
Composed for solo Cello and Tape, this piece is centered on Orfeo's reaction to learning that his love had died.  The main theme was derived from  theme found in the second recitative of Monteverdi's opera Orfeo.

60 seconds (2005) -Percussion Ensemble

Song of Sorrow  (2005)-SATB choir

Voices for Viola and Trumpet (2007) -Viola, Trumpet, Piano Percussion and conductor
This piece centers around feelings of insecurity, and fear.  The conductor takes the role as the person with self doubt.

Silent Cries (2006) -written for string ensemble
Program notes:
This piece was provoked by Mahmoud Ahmadunejad's absurd denial of the more then six million Jewish people murdered during the second world war.  Upon hearing his ridiculous denials I felt compelled to learn more about genocides around the world.  This research opened my eyes to the horror of well over 100 million innocent people exterminated due to hate and ignorance in genocides that took place throughout the modern world in the last hundred years.  The people murdered by the Nazi's in Europe during the second world war is not about numbers nor imagination, but sadly a fraction of the other genocides that took place worldwide in the 20th century, such as those in China, Japan, USSR, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Rwanda, Iraq, Aghanistan, Uganda, Bangladesh, Luberia, Sierra Leone, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Guatemala, Chad, Taiwan, Haiti, Spain, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Chile, and Argentina to name a few.

"Antiochus III 

The prophecy in Daniel about Antiochus is an example of vaticum ex eventu.  Daniel is known, in the form we have it, to have been written pseudepigraphically in the 2nd century BC (the Aramaic middle chapters may be a century or so earlier) during Antiochus' persecution of the Jews 1, 2, 3 (also see Encarta, Albertz 1988, Dever 2001, the Jerusalem Bible's introduction, probably any introductory textbook to biblical studies); I took out the reference to the prophecy because 1) saying there is a mysterious prophecy that some believe refers to Antiochus is misleading; the prophecy does refer to him, because it was written during his reign retroactively, and 2) stating this in the article will generate an edit war with evangelicals, which is bad for the quality of the article.  Therefore, since it is a peripheral detail, I believe it is best left out of the article; it is dealt with in the Book of Daniel article, which can be linked to the article on Antiochus.",0

"Osteosarcoma Risk 
I have edited the statement regarding the association between neutering and osteosarcoma (OSA) because it was far stronger than the citation, or the literature in general, supports. In a single study of a single breed with a known risk for osteosarcoma far higher than most other breeds, the data showed the total lifetime exposure to sex hormones was negatively correlated with the incidence of OSA. The incidence of the disease was not statistically different between neutered and intact animals overall, though it was different between animals neutered at less than 1 year of age and intact animals. And there is no reason to suggest these findings would support a general relationship between neutering and OSA incidence in other breeds or mixed-breed dogs. Given the questionable clinical significance of the finding (intact animals actually died slightly, though not significantly, earlier than neutered animals overall) and the much more thoroughly demonstrated protective benefits of neutering on life expectancy and other kinds of cancer, I do not find this study sufficient to support a general assertion that OSA risk is a meaningful disadvantage of neutering.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",1

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1

"""

I had already been told why they weren't vandalism?  The reasoning offered was insufficient.  I quoted from the rules.  I showed where he broke the rules.  That was never refuted.  
I warned a vandal.  He reverted the warning more than once.  He never replaced it with one that he felt was more appropriate.  How can I not assume you are biased in this matter?  You are carrying on a very fascinating conversation with him on your talk page about groking or whatever, and I get blocked?  I make one comment you deem inappropriate and denounce it as """"scathing""""?  
Let's look at the wrong behavior Daedalus engaged in on WP:ANI just now:
""""I knew he wouldn't really notice the block...""""  That's false.  I noticed the block.
I'm done assuming good faith with you.  WP:AGF  blatant.
...you're trolling for some kind of response.""""  False, and fails to assume good faith.
""""You have so far been nothing but disruptive."""" False, and basically the same kind of comment I just got a one week block for.
""""...the way you warned those IPs is classified as a personal attack."""" False, and false statements about other editors are not allowed under the civility rules.
""""You've been nothing but rude since you got here...""""  False, as his statement contains an absolute.  Even using the most liberal definition of rude, I have not been """"nothing but rude...""""
""""...the user claimed that I was ready to resign...""""  False, and that represents a serious misrepresentation of my comment.
""""this information that he claimed to have had(but of course, did not) about me resigning...""""  False, as I never claimed to have information about him resigning.  Patently false.
""""...that was a twinkle edit summery, an edit summery that is created automatically by the script when in use...""""  Using automation isn't a defense to bad edits or edit summaries.
""""I removed your message from my review...""""  He concedes to vandalism.
""""...you might be something else...""""  Obvious failure to assume good faith.
""""Are you sure you read that entire page?""""  Sarcasm during a heated debate is quite clearly incivility.
As a side note, I see Redvers has accused me of calling established editors """"vandals"""" on Wikipedia.  As far as I remember, that too is false.  I said Daedalus969 committed vandalism, and I said he was on the side of vandals, but I never called him a vandal.  Keep in mind also that what Redvers just did, by the rules, was incorrect.   
Yet, for my one alleged mistake, I get a one week block.  Daedalus, on the other hand, gets not so much as even one warning?  This is a mockery.  How I am I supposed to think, given the evidence, that you weren't doing anything other than looking for one mistake on my part, whether real or imagined, to hit me with a block?  You're having a friendly conversation with this guy while he's committing vandalism, incivility, personal attacks, page blanking, false statements, and bad edit summaries, and I get toasted for one arguable slip?  No, no, no, """"scathing"""" slip.  Please.  
Note also that many of his bad moves such as this have absolutely no merit.  Please tell me, how much of his nonsense was I supposed to be able to endure?  The deck was stacked.  He's breaking the rules while making accusations against me, and I'm expected to turn the other cheek how many times?  I guess since I said I was done in my last WP:ANI post, it might have seemed like the last chance to hit me with a block, rather legitimate or not.

 Comment 

My comments on Malleus' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. 

For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to """"bait"""" or """"poke"""" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. 

I lost respect for Malleus when he said, """"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick."""" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.

But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. 

It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.

With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.

I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that """"we don't care if we offend our readers."""" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.

And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and """"sex tape"""" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.

The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the """"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard"""" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked """"Should we mention the tape?"""" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.

And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. 

Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.

Greg, have just copy-edited the quote in that footnote and in """"Criticism"""" (punctuation & format) and got to thinking about the word """"sacrifice"""".

So I should stop replying to you and let you get the last word here on your talk page. However, you did state """"For some of the claims, there are evidence, but others, there are not."""" So that's a start to  you seemingly acknowledging your belief that there is some valid evidence for the material you dispute.  

The text doesn't state that """"men [don't know] how to."""" It states something that Kinsey concluded, and it is clearly attributed to Kinsey  """"Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do."""" We are allowed to mention researchers' conclusions, and this conclusion by Kinsey is especially relevant to the text. It's also what I just stated above: """"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying."""" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that """"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship."""" I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz's assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. And I reiterate that Schwartz was focusing on long-term lesbian relationships, not just on lesbian relationships in general.   

The article is not a comparison article. It mentions a few comparisons to heterosexual sex in the Research section because these comparisons are notable and especially relevant to the topic. This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn't. But I agree that it should be included in the article. 

We don't have to list stats for the lines you quoted above. What we have to do is follow the sources. If the sources had stats, then maybe we would include those. But including them also doesn't mean that they would be traded out for the text material. The """"Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact"""" line is about lesbians only, and it's supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you've done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that """"many other sources"""" show the opposite of the material you kept removing. If there were many other sources of such nature, you'd be able to present one other than the Schwartz study, which is not an opposing study (as in a study directly going against what the studies in the article have found).

 Exactly why this article should be deleted 
Since some editors have deplorable difficulty understanding (as ITAQALLAH laments """"but on the talk page never explains in detail how the content is in accordance with policy, and ignores any policies that I may cite"""") why this article deserves to be deleted, I will once more explain now being very precise and exact so that you may be cleared of all doubts.

The article (in its post-censorsed state) is in violation of WP:BLP.
Let me quote from it: 

Editors must take particular care adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page. Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States and to all of our content policies, especially:

 Neutral point of view (NPOV)
 Verifiability
 No original research

This article violates requirement number One: Neutral point of view (NPOV)

Now for idiotic editors (like those who childishly colour their usernames) who will have difficulty comprehending how on earth this article violates NPOV (owing to their idiocy, which I hope Eugenics will fix one day) let me quote section 2.5 from the NPOV page:

Balance

When reputable sources contradict one another, the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner.

It says """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""". And where does this article do that ???
Rather than describe describe the opposing viewpoints, it suppresses opposing viewpoints.

This is why the article is biased, censorsed and therefore must be deleted.

I will be re-inserting the PROD tag in 24 hours if no one can come up with an argument that justifies having a biased viewpoint or can explain why and how the """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""" requirement is insignificant enough to be ignored. -   """,0

Ok, so you are then telling the removal of sourced information is absolutely fine on Wikipedia and not vandalism. Does this mean I can highlight all the information in this article, press the backspace button on my keyboard and then get awarded a BarnStar?

Mutual masturbation has nothing to do with masturbation, it is non-penetrative sex. The word """"masturbation"""" is only used as a euphemism, just because handjob and fingering are similar to the way a male or famale masturbates. Mutual masturbation is actually handjob and fingering, which of course is non-penetrative sex, not masturbation! Mutual masturbation is not about two people sitting opposite to each other and masturbating without touching one another, this is nonsense! If no contact exists, this is simple masturbation, no matter how close two persons are to each other. No contact = Masturbation. Contact = """"Mutual masturbation"""" (euphemism for handjob and fingering) = Non-penetrative sex. I hope you understand the difference!

Title reign tables, etc

As the author of the Title History section, I think that the tables are horrible.   I didn't make it that way because it's ugly for anyone that has low screen resolutions.  They are also harder to read in my opinion.  At least, with my presentation of the information, they were easy and straight forward to read.
 02:10, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Finally created an account here, I'm the one who made the tables. Well, I think that my version of the Title History looks better and is better to read. But maybe I'm the only one who thinks that way? I'd like to hear other opinions.
I changed the look of the tables a bit, do they look okay?

I have made two versions of the """"Title History"""" tables now. You can see the other one at Stone Cold Steve Austin. I think the table in Austins article is a bit long. The table in Benoits article might be unfriendly for users with lower resolutions. What do you think which table should be used for the Title Histories for the wrestlers?  12:54, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Do you really need a mini-paragraph for every PPV title event Benoit has?  I mean, in a year, is anyone going to care that Benoit had a US title match against Orlando Jordan at the Great American Bash?

Having a detailed account of every Benoit appearance on SmackDown! is not only tedious, it's unnecessary. -  

Regarding Benoit having """"Super Tombstone Piledriver"""" as a Benoit does regularly, um, no. At one time, a very long time ago, he was doing piledrivers as part of his moveset, but he hasn't done a piledriver, super or otherwise, in many years, dating even well before the ban on dangerous moves in WWE. At this point, anyone who even knows that Benoit did a piledriver at one time should be rewarded for their knowledge of very miniscule trivia. I'm removing it. Someone can consider adding it in as trivia if they like.  

Quotes I WILL MAKE YOU TAP OUT come on he says that!   err

I think Benoit does actually have the record for the longest time in the Royal Rumble. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble#Royal_Rumble_Records  ToneLa

IMO, the Personal Life section needs a little bit of an overhaul.  There's the background as to what led to him and Nancy having an affair (Kevin Sullivan told them to travel and appear in public together to maintain kayfabe, to the point of having Nancy grope Chris in bars) leading to the various """"Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce"""" comments over the years, Nancy changing her name legally to Nancy Benoit (I'm 99% sure of this, as Dave Meltzer, who's friends with Benoit, exclusive refers to her as """"Nancy Benoit""""), and I'm pretty sure he and Nancy had a second child together.   

At the end of the World Wrestling Entertainment section (where it discusses Benoit's neck injury) it states Chris injured his neck in a match with X-Pac. However, I remember reading a quote by Benoit himself where he stated that he actually injured it in a match with Austin (while taking a stunner) and the superplex in the Triple Threat at KoTR simply injured him further. Can anyone verify this?

I do start articles, but once there they provide a convenient uh coat hook to paste other information as encountered in the media. Footnoting and objectivity is the main problem.

Hi Bogdan. Regarding this your talk message: you can use the image request templates for filing standard images requests that will be automatically put to the respective category. I'd even ask you to do so. I requested that category to be populated: we need thousands of images on UA-related pages, so potential photographers (mappers etc.) need a consistent to-do list.

"Regarding my edit on Final Fantasy (series) 

I originally made an edit to remove what I believed to be false information - that Final Fantasy XI was the first in the series to feature a fully rotating camera. However, I decided that since I could not immediately verify that I was correct, I should not have made the edit. Consequently, I re-edited the entry to restore its original text. The point being, I may have acted rashly, but I quickly corrected my possible mistake, and I do not believe that my actions warranted any sort of reprimand - even one as mild as I received.",0

It is a popular misconception that the sun is at its greatest elevation above the horizon at noon every day. This misconception is reflected in the """"Measurement"""" section: """"...the difference of the heights of the Sun above the horizon at noon on the longest and shortest day of the year is twice the obliquity.""""

Because of the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, the angular velocity of the Earth's orbital motion is not constant. The axial tilt of the Earth also causes a periodic variation in the time that the Sun reaches the meridian. As a result, the Sun may cross the meridian (and reach its maximum height above the horizon) as early as 16 min 33 s before noon (around November 3) or as late as 14 min 6 sec after noon (around February 12). This is explained in detail on the “Equation of time” page.

Of course there is always a tradeoff between maximum scientific accuracy on the one hand and the goal of keeping articles simple and straightforward for non-technical readers on the other hand.

One possibility: “...the difference of the maximum heights of the Sun above the horizon at midday on the longest and shortest day of the year is twice the obliquity.”

The last paragraph of the section would also need to be tweaked similarly.

If they are notable, find a source that says that they are notable. These list of favorite players should be removed from this page, as well as from the other position articles. Dil 

Who says these players are notable? What criteria is being used to determine who is or isn't notable?
It's completely unsourced POV. Come to some consensus criteria for what is going to be considered notable, and then add players back along with sources showing they meet these criteria. These sections are completely unacceptable per WP:A as they are currently written. Dil 
The notable player section is pure WP:OR and even if they meet a standard (say All star game the year before), there'll be other standards that makes other players notable.    

See the soccer positions those all have lists and these lists can let people easily see some famous players without having to see another page. The standard is those players have won awards before such as All-Stars such as Tony Parker, MVPs such as Steve Nash or All-NBA teams Steve Nash and Billups. New England(Black Harry) also agrees with me and to prove it see:Talk:Power forward (basketball).  
That's circular logic...Because soccer players have it, basketball players should?   Just because another user agrees with you means it should be in there.   I'm opposing based on the notion that wikipedia should not be setting the criteria on who is a notable PG and who is not.    

Regarding soccer positions, WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS.

Also, please note that I started a new discussion on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject National Basketball Association. This isn't something that should be decided on an article talk page if the resulting consensus is going to affect multiple pages within the scope of a project.  Dil 

There is no need to describe the other point guards who have won the MVP as """"much shorter."""" Oscar Robertson was also tall for the position at 6'5. Steve Nash is taller than many point guards at 6'3. Magic Johnson was an anamoly at pg because he was so tall.  It is confusing to describe the others as short simply because they did not have his height. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

"Agent To The Stars is a progressive rock band from Rimba, Gadong, B.D. The band consisted Preston Yusof (lead vocals, guitars, piano, keyboards), Yusra Taib (bass, backup vocals), Nizam Yusof (drums, backup vocals).

Early Years
History
The band was formed in the February 6 2008 along with Foretance by Preston Joseph, Preston formed a band in 2007 with the same members in it except Sham Bahrin after he rest off his acting career, but the band didn’t work out well, cause the band was moving really fast, and the band members still doesn’t know how to play the instruments.

Preston has pursue his solo career for a try and he almost release his album but it was not succesful, and he formed a group named Foretance in February 6 2008 along with a new band named Boys Do Cry, the band consists the same members, and the band has abandoned the name of the band and performed at 4 Aces Studio without no name.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam. The band later posted a few novel names in the internet, and let the worldwide people vote which is the best name, there are 6 names, Mirza took Agent To The Stars (by John Scalzi), Morning Star (by Simon Raven), and more, but there are 11 votes on Agent To The Stars, which led the band to take the name.",0

"Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis 

I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.

There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.

A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.

The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.

What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.

"I'm not clear whether a picture of a child's genitalia is legitimate or not - you appear to be more familiar with the way it works than me; perhaps you should ask whether images of children's genitalia are acceptable on Wikipedia.

I object to it for several reasons.  The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this.  Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications.  I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people.  So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex?  No, it is not.  So, why is it there?  Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails.  I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary.  People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia.",0
"Institute of Noetic Sciences 

I see you reverted my adjustment to the Stephen Barrett criticism of the Institute of Noetic Sciences.  I believe you acted in good faith.  I also believe the revert was erroneous.

Barrett's list is published information.  Counting the number of organizations on the list does not represent original research.  It is simply a way of summarizing the context in which Barrett's criticism occurred.  It is information that is directly and explicitly supported by the source.  It is a routine calculation that most people over the age of six could perform for themselves.

As the article stands now, it is misleading and unbalanced.  A casual reader gets the impression that Barrett targeted the IONS out for special and specific criticism, when in fact his criticism was spread over hundreds of organizations.

 Withdrawn charges 

The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.

What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.

To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse. Furthermore, the fact that the IP address 72.136.34.96 spontaneously lost the ability to make edits without logging in with no explanation could also show a certain level of abuse of administrative rights (by the way.

 Plot

Depp remembers, """"He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse.

Later on under the sub heading Reaction, it says:
Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.

 Various explanations 

The Law School is the only other major graduate school that belongs to UM, so I added it to the intro with the Med School and Marine School.

There is not enough content to split off to make into a separate article on the Business School just because the GA reviewer said that it could be split off.

None of the links to the Miami Herald or Sun Sentinel articles actually point to the articles that they used to because they've been kicked off to the archives.

A whole paragraph dedicated to the strike is not necessary considering that there is a mention of the strike two paragraphs earlier.

I don't know why the Iron Arrow paragraph was removed at all. This just looks like more of Racepacket's bias against its inclusion.

I've changed this article's assessment to C-class from Start-class. It's clearly no longer a start anymore, and developing some clear structure and order. Some of the language is still a little choppy in places, and could use a good copyedit by a native english speaker. The history section seems to be a little heavy on the subsections, and some of those could be combined. Some of the subsections overall could have shorter and more concise titles as well. There are a good number of photos in the article, which is good, but they seem to be cluttered over on the right side of the article, and should probably be placed a bit more evenly. Also, many of the image captions are very, and should be shortened as well. Photo captions, as a rule, shouldn't really introduce any new content to the article, and should be brief enough to simply describe the photo they're attached to. All photos should also be relevant to the article text and sections that they are placed in as well, with some sort of text in the main article discussing it.

Remember that Taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the CCP and the KMT before World War II, with Mao even being quoted in the 30's as supporting Taiwan independence from Japan.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

Please see this thread and consider giving new page creators some breathing room before tagging their pages for deletion. In this case, you tagged within 2 minutes of creation. Unless it's an attack page or something, give the editor some time to work with the article. Thanks, –xenotalk 
Admittedly I was on the fence in regards to this article and perhaps should have simply tagged it for improvement or as a stub. I allowed my review of the creator's block log to skew my opinion on an unreferenced bio. And I realize I misunderstood the inapplicability of G4's to speedy deletes.
But in general, as a NP patroller I feel that my purpose is to filter pages on creation.  With the volume of speedy deletes we generate, there are going to be occasional disputes regarding our reasoning.  However, in the vast majority these proposals for deletion are necessary soon after creation or the article will be lose the benefit of input from an experienced editor unless someone on recent changes happens to notice the article as it is being modified. If bad articles slip past this initial screening I feel it would increase the workload of the pool of editors as a whole.  This is just my own personal philosophy and I will attempt to avoid causing you too many headaches in the future.

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] 

This is full-blown crazy. What does """"non-nationals"""" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

Since most non-Jewish residents are concentrated in the eastern part of the city, and the count of 410,000 people refers to the 1948-67 Jordanian municipality borders, that would mean that only about 52% of east Jerusalem is populated by non-Jews, and western Jerusalem is populated only by 280,000 persons.

[edit] Gundagai
Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",1

Concentrate: It is prohibited to work as a guide when you have no licence. This rule holds almost everywhere in the world.

"""

UNPRODUCTIVE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS or why the word """"PRACTISED"""" is not the case of Lubitz's earlier actions. Very often people who intend to commit suicide have had many interrupted attempts to do it when """"suicidal impulse"""" is not strong enough to overcome """"natural fear"""" and """"resistance of rational thought"""". For example, people trying to commit suicide with a gun often put the weapon to their head and then they interrupt this action moments before they pull the trigger. Viewed from the side, those unsuccessful suicide attempts are like theatrical act but this is just an illusion because every such attempt has the potential to end tragically. In the case of Lubitz - in the situation in which he intended to carry out his suicide there are several circumstances that limit his freedom of choice to interrupt the suicidal attempt - such as """"returning of the Captain"""" or """"what you are doing in the cabin?!"""". These circumstances can force his unproductive suicide attempts to became productive one in any moment and he knows that after them he will have no choice to turn back. For this reason it is """"normal"""" he to do first timid attempts - which were unsuccessful in the first flight """"Duesseldorf to Barcelona"""" because time is not limited. On his return back """"Barcelona to Duesseldorf"""" the end destination is forcing him. As I said he has not """"PRACTISED"""" but was """"TRYING"""" to commit suicide or in other words - he had unproductive suicide attempt.  """,0

The ravings written above by Kimberly Williams would probably be considered evidence of some form of emotional or personality disturbance by most people. The claims she makes above lack credibility. The link to Williams' own web site simply contains more of her unfounded rantings. Williams seems to understand so little about Wikipedia that she does not understand that Andrea James is NOT the author of the Wikipedia biography about her. The information about the colleges  Andrea James has attended and her degrees from them are well known and easily verified facts. The other facts in the Andrea James biography are also easily verified. There is no requirement that Andrea James provide documentation about the biography of her to Wikipedia editors. If Ms. Williams were at all credible, it would be her responsibility to produce notarized letters from Wabash College and the University of Chicago that Ms. James did not receive degrees from them. Ms. James is a well known author, film maker, and activist whose laudable efforts are well documented. Ms. James activities are also well documented by national magazines, newspapers, and television appearances. Ms. Williams has no such credibility. The evidence is clear, from Ms. Williams infantile response above, and her infantile behavior on Wikipedia and elsewhere on the internet that her beliefs are the product of some form of delusion on her part.

I would just like to note that I do not see why my last comment was deleted, Charles. (Nor indeed why the comment by Jess was deleted). 

This entry was being vandalised by somebody who describes Hari as a """"little tyke"""" and was abusing other commenters by accusing them of being impostors. Given the opportunity to prove these people were not impostors, he refused. I was only pointing this out, so it can be borne in mind in future if this person continues to try to vandalise this entry.

How can responding to personal abuse with calm, reasoned arguments like this be described as itself personal abuse?

I totally understand why you are keen to shut down the nasty sniping that was becoming common here, but I don't think that's achieved by silencing people who are trying to point out personality-motivated vandalism so it too can be stopped.

Please don't just delete this message; it's really important to put down a polite, civilised marker about this. I think there is a strong case, once somebody has started abusing the subject of an entry in odd ways and abusing literally everybody else who edits it, to ban them from contributing further. To instead ban anybody who raises this question seems perverse. I think we should discuss it in a calm way, that doesn't accuse anybody of being a mysterious impostor or make any personal attacks.

"Hi, CK. Thanks for your explanation. It looks like you left out a word or something in your edit summary; anyway, I didn't get it.
I considered your explanation and looked at the article (left it, looked again, left it, ...) and I have come to the conclusion that the certs listing as you've changed them just look too much like a random order. The alpha-by-provider is neater, in my view, than the provider-in-order-of-country-where-we-have-one. Maybe your way would look better if we always had 10 charts and 10 certs, and they'd sort of match up. Not sure.
In any case, if you feel strongly about your preference on Katy Perry discography, I'd guess you'll want that system on every article, yes? In that case (especially), it would be great if you would (re-)start a discussion of the sorting of the certs over at WT:DISCOGSTYLE. There, you'd have a chance of building consensus one way or the other (it was most recently for alpha-by -provider, but concensus can change, and it's a smallish group there). We'd expend less energy on reversions and explanations then. Thanks again for your explanation. —",0

Sometimes, however, classes were organised for students of more than one college held at one of those colleges; this would generally occur on an ad-hoc basis. 
All my LECTURES were given by Comlab/MInstitute professors to everyone studying that subject in the University. All exams were set centrally by the Comlab/Minstitute.

Greetings,

I would like to raise an issue regarding the 'Cambodia' page where you reverted an deletion I made. I don't know weither you thought my IP was a robot randomly deleting part of articles in wikipedia, I can assure you I'm not )

If you carefully look at what I deleted (and the reasons why I did it, see in the discussion page on the article), you will hopefuly understand my motives and remove once more what I considered a paragrap that goes against the neutral pov policy of wikipedia.

 This CWCC story should go in wikinews as far as I'm conserned, it's an on-going story.
 I'm living in Cambodia since 2 years and while I've heard more than once stories of perpetrators buying the families of the victims to drop the charges and make false testimonies, this on-going story does not represent the general picture in the case. Right now the paragraph offers only one very subjective point-of-view, is focussed only on one case rather than trying to be general (like the article 'Cambodia' should be), and relies on only 1 more or less reliable news source
 The 'Cambodia' entry should not be used to try to make a point and help a person getting out of jail in a corrupted country.

Please remove this badly written paragraph that goes against the ethic code of wikipedia. Thanks ( )",0

The prejudicial error in using Google as an arbitrator in a situation like this is that any search for 'Yonsei' will also bring results for 'Yonsei University' etc as a partial search results.

Yonsei means yonsei, Yonsei University is Yonsei University. Neither the hospital nor journals were ever called """"Yonsei"""". The whole debate has been bogus and poisoned. 118.16.165.249  """,1

 Some things about the Dutch and German education systems 
The Dutch name """"Hoger beroepsonderwijs"""" (abbrev. as HBO, though HBO (disambiguation) links to the misspelled redirect Hoger Beroeps Onderwijs) links here, but this seems to be in error, as they are not the same. For example, according to this article, a vocational university can give away master, and sometimes doctorate degrees, but a HBO in The Netherlands can do neither of them. An example of such an organisation is the Hanzehogeschool Groningen. They are not allowed to use the Dutch word for """"university"""" in their Dutch name but  but rather are what we call a Hogeschool, and what German call Fachhochschule, to confuse the world, they often call themselves """"university of applied sciences"""" in the English language. I would propose to link """"Hoger beroepsonderwijs"""" and HBO to a new article called something like """"University of Applied sciences in Europe"""" and redirect HBO, Hogeschool and Fachhochschule there. The contents of this new page can largely be taken from Fachhochschule.   """,0

ive posted this on the clairvoyance talk page after someone completely removed the clar#irsentience article which had gone through a process of months of work , rewrites , endless discussion , removasl of personal matereal , edits for style and content .... endless work on correct sourcing and wikpedia referencing and formatting.....  the article which had been arrived at with co operation and discussion over many weeks and v man who himself put some hours into grammer , punctuation ... re editting for stlye and content ... and much help in correct sourcing and referencing  ..... 

this article was the sum  of many peoples input , effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page... any help would be great.... cheers.. 

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour .....
clairsentience article redirect ?

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

..... i hope you can respect the clairsentience article...

..... ive been clairsentient for most of my adult life and it wasnt easy to come this far and to struggle for  decades to articulate my experience in a way which makes rational sense to the world at large of which the clairsentience article is a manifest example..... so please try and respect the vast amount of struggle and work which has gone into it....

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1

Manchus

In April you reverted my edits with the comment that """"This paragraph was vandalized from previous revisions. It drastically changed from its original source."""".

Whether the changes are justified or not, they were not vandalism as they were explained at the discussion page for Manchus (""""Manchus and political football""""). Before reverting edits on the strength of charges of vandalism, I would be grateful if you could check the talk page and first address arguments made there.

My objection to the statement that """"Much recent scholarship in ethnic identity emphasizes that ethnic categories, rather than being static and objective, are fluid and subjective"""" is the fact that this could apply to ANY ethnic group, and could thus be placed at any article on any ethnic group. Making this specific point only at the article on the Manchus sounds like a rationalisation or excuse. It sounds highly defensive, as though there is no real basis for asserting Manchu ethnic identity other than the over-subtle distinctions of academics. We know that Crossley argued from this point of view, but is it necessary to incorporate this in the article? It's almost as if the article were saying """"We know the Manchus are not considered an ethnic group, but if ethnicities are regarded as fluid and subjective, we can perhaps recognise them as such"""". 

The Qing dynasty was based on an apartheid-like situation where the Chinese and Manchus were kept apart. During the Qing the Manchus retained a consciousness of being a separate ethnic group, even after they mostly switched to speaking Chinese. There are still Manchus today who retain a consciousness of the separateness of Manchu culture, quite apart from the state-sponsored ethnic categories. So my point is, why do we have to bend over backwards to try and justify a viewpoint simply because it is at odds with the current consensus? Is there a need to be so pointedly defensive just in the case of the Manchus?

She may not have used those precise words, but she did say """"Toss it out and start over? Yes, because it's based on a false premise. Our health care system is based on the premise that health care is a commodity like VCRs or computers and that it should be distributed according to the ability to pay in the same way that consumer goods are.

Smmarising the long piece as """"incremental changes in a free-market system are """"doomed to fail"""" does not seem inacurate to me because she is calling for wholesale reform and stating that free market principles should not apply.

I really don't care all that much about the Jewish lists and categories.  I've voted on some of them, mostly because other editors have solicited my input (I think with more confidence in what I would opine than is merited).  My votes on those have been mixed, and have depended on how specific the topics are, and whether I think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion.  But I'm neither one of those people who votes """"keep"""" for anything with the word """"Jewish"""" in it; nor am I an editor who votes """"delete"""" whenever I see the word (we have some of each, and I think both are acting with a bit of bad faith).

I am, however, very offended by abuse of the administrative systems of WP in violation of WP:POINT.  I guess you're a newbie, and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures.  We all start out that way.  In actual fact, there is a """"criteria for speedy deletion"""" that allows removal of pages that have been previously deleted by AfD.  There are a lot of rules floating around, and they are not all consistent with each other, so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing all, or even most, of them.

But an AfD is for a very specific thing, and something very different from your spurious nomination.  FWIW, Arniep also violated WP:POINT by massively nominating """"Jewish Foo"""" lists that he actually wanted kept.  And he got blocked for 48 hours (rightly) as a warning.  What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.  And it is not a way to get even with editors who voted """"delete"""" on some other page that you believe is conceptually equivalent to the page you nominate.

There are lots of pages that I think should be better, and where I think the editors are putting in material that is not encyclopedic, and where the structure of the article is not optimal (maybe it needs refactoring into subpages).  As a good WP citizen who follows Wikiquette, I raise those issues on the article talk pages.  I attempt edits to the page directly.  Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.  What I do not do is nominate pages that I think cover worthwhile topics for AfD as a way of bullying the editors whose edits I do not like.

If you follow Wikiquette, you'll get along with people here, and be a productive editor.  If you violate it, you'll make lots of enemies, increase general animosity, and fail to get anything done.  Your start so far has not been portentious; but you certainly have time left to learn, and to make amends.  """,0

"What a hypocrite this creep Chavez is!

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!",1

I feel bad, too, JG. I know I can have a real smart, sarcastic mouth when I get totally frustrated, and when it gets going, look out! I apologize... Seriously. I don't want bad blood between us.

I do have a POV, of course. We all do. But in an entry that is explaining the traditionalist POV (where there is """"the"""" trad POV), it matches. And when it comes to external links/further reading (not """"sources""""), then traditionalist websites deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to """"An Orthodox Hannukah"""" or """"Reformed Readings for Hannukah,"""" but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can't add a link for balance, or add """"a traditional Catholic site"""" tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removes and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summaries.

I am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled """"a traditional Catholic site"""" or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex., is labelled a """"conservative"""" or """"neo-conservative"""" site  not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains). 

I'm glad you liked at least most of the page on the Rosary! (I think if you looked at the links mentioned in my RfC, you will actually like them, too  at least most of them. Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the """"Customs of the Liturgical Year"""" section. There is nothing like it out there on the Net, and I'm not finished yet!) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives/neo-conservatives: you use the phrase """"attacks on Pope John Paul II"""" with regard to the footnote about trads' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don't see it as an """"attack"""" but a criticism. Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, """"to the face"""" when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).

But no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don't have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics!), there is a trad """"movement"""" out there, and we have as much """"right"""" to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we're not even Catholic at all and there's a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to """"Anglican Rosary practices."""" I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censored, and it frustrates me (it doubly frustrates me when links like this aren't only removed, but are labelled """"blog"""" or """"[[monograph|monographs]"""". It's beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it).

I will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word """"a traditional Catholic site"""" or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trad site is clear. If I come across any older links that have already been added (and not all have been added by me, BTW), I will edit to do the same. Sound good? 

I am glad you wrote; I feel TONS better already...  """,0

"On the law of Kamma 

I have added a section on the law of Kamma. I prefer to call it Kamma (pali) instead of Karma ( sanskrit) as there is a negative meaning associated with Karma. Karma in the Hindu context means that ones deeds performed in previous lives are responsible for ones present conditions. This is a very pernicious Hindu doctrine and has been advanced by Hindu priests to escape from the social responsibility of alleaviting a man's condition. As per this doctrine all the poverty stricken, destitute people in this world must have been criminals in their previous lives. This cannot be true

The Buddhist law of kamma differs from the Hindu theory of Karma in this aspect. The buddhist law of kamma states that all actions are irreversable. That one cannot get rid of ones sins by asking for forgiveness or taking a bath in the holy river. An act once performed will leave its effect permanently on the society. It is the law of kamma that explains the maintainance of moral order in the world. It has nothing to do with the fortunes or misfortunes of people due to their actions in the previous birth.",0

Accepting their claims as the total truth is certainly problematic; it is made even more so when there isn't a way to actually check the veracity of the claim. Not being able to read the article, because of their damned clickthrough ads, I would personally appreciate if someone could post the section of the article in question. For the time being, """"Salon claims. . ."""" is certainly the NPOV way to go.

"Hello Ben, 

If you are going to insert a NPOV header on the page, you are supposed to justify all and every point you have in mind, not completely smash up a page, and then rewrite it with no discussion or debate as a Watchtower PR exercise. Many others here have covered these issues over and over and the page has been approved by two administrators in regard to the eschatology section. My edits were reverting, not altering the main text sections. I only edited the last 1995 bit, and you've said nothing about that, except made unfounded claims. All major changes are supposed to be discussed first, and you have not done that, you have just ripped out the factual material and done a whitewash edit in apologist speak to look like it was all a minor dream or something.

A couple of points I will pick up on were where you claimed in regard to 1799, 1914, 1920, and 1925 etc., that they were “suggestive and purely speculative”, but Ben, not one of those dates falls into your apologist descriptions, you are clearly not being reasonable, rational, or honest

You then say “Progressive adjustments of understanding in the face of unfolding events, resulted in a period of changing explanations centered around the years 1914, 1918, 1920, and 1925.” That is also incorrect because those dates were only changed after their humiliating failure, not before. It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction, where the world is still looking on, long after the end was supposed have arrived! You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance, when they were anything but that at their times of publishing. An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say “Other dates variously considered being time of God's judgement”. Since when were they “variously considered”? They forcefully stated, “we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt. Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed. . .” and “This chronology is not of man, but of God. Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated, present-truth chronology stands in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct.” What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben. Why? What is your agenda? If you are embarrassed, get over it. You should not destroy, whole pages due to your religious ties to the JWs.

Ben, you said “They do not profess to be inspired”, but they use ever synonym in the book that directly implies that exact same thing, see quotes here 1 and here 2, why are you hiding this balance?

There are a lot more points that you are misleading and censoring for your own agenda, and that is not the purpose of Wikepedia. I get the impression you are possibly a naïve JW who does not know about the real history of your religion (please don’t take offence at this, it is a common thing), and so you edit in good faith that your indoctrinated info from the watchtower org is correct. Please do some detailed research before you vandalise many editors' hard work. Wikepedia is here for accurate information, be it good or bad, but not public relations platform for religious groups and their biases. You have also repeatedly changed long accepted text with no discussion. Can I suggest you look up the 14 pages of talk and read them all carefully before you abuse the hard work of others with your grossly biased unauthorized edits. Best wishes.  17th of September, 2005 PS. For more info, read some oh the Watchtower org’s published material here. 1914, 1975, and the whole lot (four pages)",0

I do not know why BogHog changed to vcite or to vcite2 after he took over maintaining the Diberri tool.  Nor do I know what that means in every case.  The case I know about is that autism used vcite instead of cite because of load time issues (Eubulides developed vcite for that purpose, but Eubulides is gone), and I remember at some point having a conversation with BogHog about the vcite vs vcite2 issues ... but the rest fades in memory.  That may or may not mean BogHog explained it all to me once  ... and I may or may not have understood at the time.  When I use Boghog's new Diberri tool, I edit the output to use the old standard form, for consistency in citation style.  And I continue to use the vcite format in the autism suite.  That we now have a mix on FAs is because new editors may not always respect CITEVAR, and I may not catch them all.

WTF do you want from me? There are (Christian) folks who think they hold the monopoly on issues such as god, morals, and Christendom as such. And there are (Jewish) folks who will do everything to control issues such as Judaism, Israel, Palestine, and parts of ancient history. The latter are called the """"jew crew"""" on fora that I have been on and I don't know or care whether that targets all Jews or all Israelis or who may feel offended by that. I did not invent the term nor do or will I give it a second thought. I, for one, am offended by religious fanaticism and nationalism (which both are reasons to present Jerusalem as the undisputed capital of Israel), and by folks who present biblical tales as accurate history (and derive political claims from that).

 Warning 

I am just here to say that bias you have against me is plainly obvious, and I am asking you kindly to back off, as I am starting to get annoyed. I am starting to think that you see my username and instinctively hit revert. You pretty much admitted this in your reversion of the 1965 Palm Sunday article. If you would simply do some basic fact checking, this could all be avoided

My change to """"Lacon, IL"""" was sourced via Grazulis, and you obviously reverted because you saw my username, and didn't even check or research the validity of my edit. I would bet money that if any other user made that edit, you wouldn't have reverted it. If you have this idea that I make willy-nilly edits with no basis, then you are mistaken. I dig through hours online resources, old newspaper archives, books, and pdf documents to find my information. I take pride in providing valuable, detailed, and verifiable info on historical tornadic events. Seeing the reversion of all this work is frustrating to say the least. All I ask is for you to trust me a little more, and actually READ the sources and information provided.

I very much enjoy and appreciate Wikipedia but it's nothing more than something I occasionally pop-in to edit or create an article occasionally. After reviewing your link, it appears my only contribution to this issue was a poorly thought-out side remark to an editor in an unrelated ANI a few months back. I never pursued the matter beyond that, nor did I file a complaint regarding the emails, nor did I even remember it occurred until I logged back on after a few months away to edit an article I'd previously written and found your many messages to me. Please understand: 
 The """"song and dance"""" is not a creature of my conjuring. I am only following up on this short exchange that I barely recall as you escalated the question and have pursued it over a period of several months. However, as I said, I am committed to doing my absolute best to accommodate your interest in this matter (in point of clarification to your above comment, I have to admit I am unaware of other third-party editors who expressed similar passion to you and seem to recall the others involved (IIRC User:NE Ent, User:Dennis Brown, User:TParis) were differently expressive, but if I am wrong then kindly accept that I should have said I am also trying to accommodate their interest as well). As far as I know, it is your interest in pursuing this I am accommodating and the characterization of a """"song and dance"""" is not one I feel is appropriate to describe my total ambivalence to your inquiry (please understand - the preceding is not intended to be trite, I simply want to unambiguously communicate that the entire matter is one of no interest to me, so as to assuage any concerns of a """"song and dance""""). 
 I would like to personally apologize to you for not responding to your interrogatories """"forthwith."""" I can only give you my personal assurance that I did not leave Wikipedia for two months as part of a scheme to evade your investigation. I know you've said you're incredulous to that notion, but I will offer you this personal assurance anyway. 
 Kindly accept this post in the spirit in which it was intended - as a frank and direct response to concerns you are expressing - and not as a slight in any way. If I have failed to communicate something here with appropriate finesse, understand it is only because of serious IRL issues I currently face that limit the time I can commit to pursuing online intrigue, and absolutely not because I am trying to scandalize you. 
If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know, however, in interests of wrapping this up in a succinct manner, I would like to suggest we terminate this back-and-forth and allow ArbCom to do whatever it is their role in this is supposed to be. Best -

 Spin Triplet/Singlet Redirects. 

Hi. It doesn't make sense to redirect """"singlet state"""" and """"triplet state"""" to an article in chemistry which actually *uses* singlet and triplet states. The chemistry article is an application of singlet and triplet states, and not a proper description of the actual (*quantum-mechanical*) phenomenon.

Please stop with the redirects. There is *NO* justification for them. Spin singlets or triplets are a QM phenomenon, and should thus be discussed in a physics context. If you wish to add a section """"for chemists"""" to the relevant (physics) pages, feel free to do so. 

PS: Pardon the incorrect use of your talk page earlier. My mistake. 
PPS: I assume you and User:The way, the truth, and the light know each other. If so, it would probably be helpful for him to stop, also. As I said: spin is physics and belongs in the category of physics. Simple.

"""

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

""":Yes, you can carry on where I left off. I have very little interest in Florida's articles beyond trying to spur or shame editors into caring and taking action. The standard joke has been that USRD needs a hurricane to come through and swipe the articles about Florida's  roadways off the website so they can be restarted from scratch with an eye towards quality. In the grand scheme of things, the state highway articles are more important than the county road articles, yet the editor base keeps arguing to retain CR articles that don't pass the General Notability Guideline. The state highways are the meat of the projects with CRs as the icing on the cake.
Florida needs an editor that will do what needs to be done, but that isn't me. I have plenty with Michigan to do. M-553 (Michigan highway) is at WP:HWY/ACR to be reviewed for promotion to A-Class, and I have several other articles that I'm preparing for promotion up the assessment scale. Combined with the work I try to do for the WikiProject, I don't have time to focus on Florida.

Now, if you just keep on with the list, implementing the manual formatting I started, then you should be able to merge the lists back together. (Since you split them, you should fix that.)

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

"Let me try to clear this up 

Hi Memlikelmendi. My name is Qwyrxian, and I'm an administrator here at Wikipedia. I wanted to try to explain what happened above in simpler terms. The first, most important thing, is that, as a general rule, you should not try to write an article about yourself. This is because we have found that people with a conflict of interest simply are unable to write good, well-sourced, neutral articles about themselves or organizations they are closely involved with. As such, once you are notable enough, someone will eventually make an article on you. If you really want to try to make an article on yourself, you should try to use the Articles for Creation process, since that will allow another editor to review your work and give suggestions.

The other reason why the article was deleted, which is tied in to what I said above, is that the article was overly promotional. It used excessive, praising language for the composer, which violates WP:NPOV. Moreover, it didn't have any references; to have an article, a subject must have been discussed in detail in multiple, independent, reliable sources. If you want to continue to pursue this article, and if Mendi has ben written about in such sources, feel free to leave a message on my talk page and I will try to help.",0

Wait.  You're not going to block me for posting an RFC?

Or did you block me just so that I couldn't go advertising the RFC on other pages where it might be relevant?

See.  There's the problem. As a non-admin, I am liable to be blackballed by admins, some of whom suffer from Projection (or do they merely think sophistry is administration?):

I performed no personal attacks.  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power.
I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.

I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate """"evidence"""" for a block.
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page).

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner.  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption.

There are 1,7000 admins on this thing.  I have no illusion that all 1,700 of them will be right all the time.  The first 20 who saw Chooserr's postings may have said """"okay by me"""".  It's the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem.  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones.  Meanwhile, a well-meaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong, demonized in the community, and the community is thrown into dysfunction.  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness, intimidation, sophistry, and dismissive attitude, followed by an abuse of power.

Do not block me.  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user.  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps' error rather than taking a skeptical attitude.  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me.

The behavior of the admins in this event is a classic abuse of power: a clique of bullies hiding their damage by increasing it.  """,1

So you think being rude in an edit summary is something you need to leave messages about, but reverting productive work without explanation is something you can happily ignore?  Seems to me that's a very warped perspective and implicitly condones what you claim not to condone.  If you believe that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, and if you want it to get better, you should rethink your priorities.  Sure, criticise my rude edit summaries if you like, but to simply ignore destructive edits like User:EncMstr's is not helpful to anyone.
If Wikipedia is going to declare itself """"the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""", then anonymous editors should not be discriminated against.  In practice, they are, by you and many, many others.  The solution to that is not for me or anyone else to create accounts but for those who actively discriminate to stop doing so.  At least you've taken the time to have a civil discussion.  That courtesy is frequently not given.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

In the Old Style dating, the year began on 25 March, whereas in the New Style it began on 1 January.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives A demonstration of New Style meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment. Additionally (more so in other parts of the world), the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar [for example, the Julian calendar in Europe and the Americas] to the (modern) Gregorian calendar.The October (November) Revolution Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.Stockton, J.R. Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles """"The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.""""Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar.

We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 O.S.

I am afraid only direct consultation of Eisenman is going to resolve this.   

'pp xxii, 143, 318, 324, 394, 416, 468-9, 607, 767, 779, 782, 843""""'

p.xxii =Though Peter’s name has now become powerful, he may not be as historical as we think he is, and the role we attribute to him may possibily be an amalgam of that of several individuals by the same name, one a martyred ‘cousin’ of both Jesus and James and their reputed successor in Palestine, Simeon bar Cleophas.’

p.143‘It is possible that the Cephas being referred to in between the references to ‘Peter’ in Paul’s letters is another ‘Simon’ or ‘Simeon’ – the Simeon bar Cleophas mentioned above as Jesus’ first cousin. Just as Simon Peter in Scripture is represented as being the successor to Jesus, this Simon or Simeon is represented by early Church tradition as being the successor to James. He is also of the family of Jesus, Cleophas being specifically denoted as the uncle of Jesus.’

BUT

p.143 ‘As we proceed, it will probably transpire that this Cleophas is not the uncle of Jesus, but rather his father, and there are traditions that to some degree represent him as such. In John 19:25, for instance, he is represented as the husband of Mary and this is probably true’ etc.

p.318 ‘the picture in early Church sources of the words of James’ successor Simeon bar Cleophas, the ‘Rechabite Priest’, who rebukes those stoning James the Just.'

p.324 ‘the election of Simeon by universal consent as ‘Bishop’ of the Church’ .- the restriction to ‘Jerusalem’ this time dropped.’

p.394 ‘Eusebius . .when discussing the election of Simeon bar Cleophas to succeed James as ‘Bishop of the Jerusalem Community’ or ‘Second Bishop’ of the early Church. Since Jerusalem was by this time in ruins, it is difficult to see Simeon simply as second Bishop of Jerusalem. (Whether Simeon is the cousin germane of Jesus, as Eusebius puts it, or the second or third brother of Jesus – also ‘Simon’ or ‘Simeon’ – will be discussed later.)

p.416 ‘Eusebius retains Hegesippus’ internal references, even though at this point he does not enumerate what these sects were. He does in a later passage where his note about the election of Simeon bar Cleophas to succeed James for some reason triggers a discussion of Hegesippus’ life.’

pp.468-9 (a) ‘Suppose we were to say, as also concluded above, that by ‘Rechabite’ Eusebius was trying to same something similar to ‘Essene’, ‘Nazirite’, or ‘Ebionite’; then out of this band of Essene or Ebionite ‘Priests’, one, James’  ‘cousin’ and successor, Simeon bar Cleophas, emerged as the next ‘Bishop of the Jerusalem Community’ in Palestine (only, after the fall of the Temple and Jerusalem, there clearly was no ‘Jerusalem Community’ any longer to speak of).’

(b) ‘If we now superimpose the story of the stoning of Stephen from Acts upon the story of the stoning of James from Epiphanious and Eusebius, then Simeon Bar Cleophas or the Rechabite Priestly ‘witness’ becomes James’ (and presumably Simeon’s) ideological adversary Paul . . Paul takes the place of his opposite number, James’ successor in Palestine, Simeon bar Cleophas – the only difference being that while one approves the other disapproves of what was done.’

"Dimitri & Nina 

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

I've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)

Now I'm going to let you have my e-mail address. If you wish, you could send me an e-mail, which would automatically give me yours. Then, once you know your e-mail has worked, please wipe off my e-address from this page after you've stored it, preferably on a private machine rather than one available for general use (open machines without good security get scanned regularly).

Blame homosexuality, the Vatican's second in command claims.""""
2)  http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/07/catholic_churchs_issue_is_homosexuality_not_pedophilia.html   """"I maintain it has been a homosexual crisis all along. The evidence is all on my side, though there is a reluctance to let the data drive the conclusion. But that is a function of politics, not scholarship.""""  Bill from the Catholic League so I think from an objective POV we can say that it has been a crisis of homosexuality with a few other contributing factors but that Celibacy, and Seminary training were not one of them.

I mean that is quite a strong assertion to make don't you think?  the idea that you can blame an institution like the Catholic Seminary for a series of generalized horrific crimes.  I don't think we can say although the abuse was pervasive, we don't have enough evidence to say that it was institutional (a byproduct of an organization, in this case the Catholic Seminary).

How could it be affirmed that the majority of the public know the names from the Funimation broadcast? Is there any source stating that? Even if that were true, Dragon Ball is known in almost all the English-speaking world, not only in the US. And that's not including the rest of the world. More importantly, the manga is the primary work, and normally the main source for most information regarding a work of fiction it's the printed work, like most American comic-book characters like Superman, Batman, Wolverine, etc.
These are the key phrases to decide what names to use:
WP:ENGLISH
""""Use the most commonly used English version of the name of the subject as the title of the article, as you would find it in verifiable reliable sources (for example other encyclopedias and reference works)."""" I honestly don't think that reliable sources will be found about this topic, at least not like encyclopedias and reference works, which leaves us with the following policy.
WP:MOS-AM
""""Characters should be identified by the names used in the official English releases of the series. If there are multiple English releases, such as both a manga and anime, use the one that is best known and that has contributed most to the work's becoming known in the English-speaking world (usually the primary work)."""" This is the key one. We have to decide which one has contributed more to Dragon Ball becoming known in the English-speaking world. In my opinion, it was the manga, since Dragon Ball has been known for a very long time thanks to it, and, in the US, the first broadcasts of the anime where unsuccessful while the manga was already a success, and I have the impression that it was this success with the manga that lead Funimation to keep on trying. But again, this is not definitive. We need the opinions of people from other English-speaking countries in order to have a more accurate perception.
If we want accuracy, which is also desirable by other Wikipedia policies, we should use the romanizations given by the author (Toriyama) in his Japanese works and then include the alternatives as stated in WP:ENGLISH. After all, most guidelines aren't meant to be a strict rule. But for the moment, first we have to define which one, manga or anime, helped more in making Dragon Ball known in the English-speaking world. And remember, US TV is not the whole English-speaking world. And if we go by the primary work, it's manga.   """,0

A tag has been placed on Blue Mountain Tunnel, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging.

 Humans SUCK 
I am ashamed of what we humans have done to planet Earth.  The corporations and business interests have put their myopic vision of more and more profits for themselves and their shareholders above everything else.  Forests clearcut, killing a 1,000 year old tree without even a second of remorse; and look at how we don't give a shit about the GIANT plastic waste problem! Nobody could give a rats ass...its out there in the Pacific, so its """"out of sight and out of mind""""with the exception of token articles or entries such as this one.  We humans have poisoned, maimed, raped, clear cutted, trawledand basically ass-fucked the planet into oblivion.  The once glorious oceans have been decimated by relentless TAKING, and never, EVER GIVING BACK.  

We humans are ugly, greedy creatures.  We have poisoned our own home, and killed off many other species.  Are ALL are part of this disgusting, shitty race called """"humans"""".  Here's hoping we don't spread our greed, pollution, and misery to other planets.  Maybe this ongoing self-destruction we are moving ahead with apace is nature's way of eventually eliminating our species from the planet??""",1
"Hi,

Taekkyeon is a sensitive topic because many people want to learn it and not enough qualified teachers to disperse the knowledge. If you truly desire to learn Taekkyeon there are only two masters in the world who know the complete system. One is in S. Korea, he doesn't teach many people. The other lives in Los Angeles, CA. The truth is, you have to either move to Los Angeles or S. Korea if you want to learn the Taekkyeon as taught by GM Song and Im Ho. 
I will tell you this. GM Song was a bodyguard of the remaining Choson Dynasty family memebers. The top Taekkyeon masters always defended the king, They were in the military. Taekkyeon was a military artform first and a civil cultural game for children and adults later. By calling Taekkyeon a civil martial art game is demoting it from its real status. However, Taekkyeon is still a Holistic Martial art with many healing aspects and a civil game for children and adults. Its all three!

Even with that, this is plot dump after plot dump with no real world commentary or critique.

The publication """"The Chamcha Age"""" - An Era of Stooges, written by Kanshi Ram is not copyrighted unless someone seems to have copyrighted it after his death. Kanshi Ram was editor of a publication """"The Oppressed Indian"""", issues of which of the late 70s and early 80s, I have read. I have also had the opportunity to witness him addressing gatherings on quite a few occasions. I felt that the content at the moment is drawn mostly from media reports that don't objectively represent this individual and his struggle for the emancipation of the downtrodden masses in India. Therefore, it should be okay to retain the first paragraph that is compiled from text on """"About the Author"""" from """"The Chamcha Age"""". At present, in web space, bspindia.org appears to be close in terms of being authentic in representing the views of the Bahujan Samaj Party, a political party founded by Kanshi Ram. Although this site claims copyright over the contents, it doesn't formally acknowledge the source from which it has drawn content that is available without copyright. I wouldn't mind writing to the webmaster@bspindia.org to get permission for use of content on their site for reproduction on wikipedia. 

Secondly, I can modify the article appropriately so that content from bspindia.org and other sources is only used as a source of 'information' instead of 'article content'.

While your closing that as """"Delete"""" was reasonable given the discussion, I and maybe some others are now wanting to develop the topic (see discussion within current Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Birungyi Barata.), and I would like both to see the edit history and to ensure that past contributors are properly credited in a re-developed list-article.  Could you possibly please restore a full copy, with edit history, of the List of law firms in Uganda article, to Draft:List of law firms in Uganda? ncram """,0

"Hi Neuromancer,

You will never get anywhere with the likes of Keepcalmandcarryon, Mastcell, Nunh-huh, etc. Going into the archives of some of the articles here on AIDS and HIV, I found that some of these people have been working, full-time it seems, on keeping these pages biased for years, and that they don't allow any edits which provide alternative information to the orthodox theory that HIV=AIDS, or anyone attached to these theories. They can be illogical, bullying, they will name-call, they will call any persons with honest questions denialists, and they will use any and every strategy no matter how ugly to keep these pages the way they want them to read. They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die. I wonder if these mercenary editors here have any idea that their policing of these pages could be leading to actual deaths in the world, as thousands of people take poison in a desperate attempt to save their lives, when they are not even sick.",0

So that fact being true in all terms, The debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the Federal Reserve Bank. If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system.

Also, if you look at the shareholders of each Fed Bank they will all lead back to the same people, mostly located in Europe. By saying that the federal reserve bank/system  does not work for profit, yet they apply interest to all loans derived from them as a source is really denying that you are credible in any way, and im not saying this as an insult, but the only reason of interest to be applied IS to make a PROFIT.

"Winifred Brunton (Wikiquette, good faith, be nice...)... 

Winifred's painting technique for the pharaonic portraits:

. . . I turned to the statutes and reliefs. These would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal-minded as were the Egyptians. Do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness-box can make? And shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer?The ancient artist was a trained observer; I would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what I could see today of the Pharaohs. This done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. And besides, the various artists who portrayed a Pharaoh did not all agree in detail among themselves. This added to the difficulty! It was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. I had recourse again to the mummy, and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification.

Certain confirmations appeared of the artists' evidence; these I accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. Discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of Sety I was begun.The costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the Museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on. Ramses II was next attempted, and I was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. Not all the Egyptologists who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick-making. To many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research.

''But one of the most famous of them all, namely Professor Breasted, gave me enormous encouragement. Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results. His kind words so stimulated me that I made similar attempts with other defunct royalties, and gradually completed the series of kings and queens which appear in these pages.",0

I honestly don't think conspiracy theories are encyclopedical (you will not find them in Britannica, Hispanica, Encarta), and unless clearly identified as such, they violate WP:UNDUE. 
To say that the PSOE backed up the Madrid bombings (which is different from backing the """"turmoil"""", but even that...), even if sourced with a POV reference, is not compliant with the other policies in Wikipedia. """"Good faith"""" has three unavoidable limitations (CITE, OR and NPOV). Remember that what """"rings true"""" or is a """"state of mind"""" based on reports that turned out to be wrong in the end, and cannot be fully verified, cannot be included in Wikipedia. If at all, all sorts of conspiracy theories could be included (and even there I have my reservations) in a very specific article, say 14-M Bombing attacks at Madrid, but not in the general Spain article. 
 It would be similar to including a sentence in the History section of United States saying that the Bush administration was behind the 9/11 attacks, according to some sources. Or, as you know, there are hundreds of conspiracy theories of """"Spain"""" against Catalonia, of which I could find dozens of """"sources"""", some of which, to many people """"ring very true"""", but they are not included in Wikipedia, and probably should not, as you would probably agree.

I'm actually taking exception to your calling me cruel things, like """"Delusional,"""" because I have a different point of view.  I'm a new editor, and I've tried to do a good job.  From the beginning, you did not welcome my discussion, my input.  You pretended to be helpful, but did it in a patronizing manner.  Wikipedia has attempted to make editing easier to include less experienced editors.  Saying you are """"experienced"""" is not persuasive in making me feel my viewpoint is less valid than yours.  Yes, your knowledge of the Wiki system has made it possible for you to remove my good-faith contributions.  And I worked hard and belieive in what I was saying.  You chose to only mock me, suspend me and belittle me.  I'll quit Wikipedia, and you will have achieved your goal of not allowing contrary points to be considered.  Yes, I know you present the charade of a """"talk page,"""" but you tend to bully everyone here who disagrees.  I'm disheartened, because I wanted to add to the discussion, but I've found no fairness, or even kindness here.  And I'm truly sorry for any unkindness on my part, but I don't believe I had a chance.  You removed my first edits, and then gave me a list of Wiki rules.  You are a selective rule-follower, and even that, in spirit only.  Following the letter of a rule, versus the intent are sometimes two different things.  You use the letter of the rule to block opposing views.  In reality, opposing views should be welcomed and presented. But I suppose you will disagree with that, put it up to a vote, and ban me for saying it.  If I hadn't already quit.

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???3) Which group of honest editors ...who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?'

I did accidentally miss some text from my post and have now corrected it. I did not intend to say you were a BNP supporter. I noticed that you had edited the British National Party article recently and that was what I said, and which I stand by. I did not even look at your edit and even if I had I could not conclude or intend to say that you are a supporter of the BNP. If it was possible to read it that way, then I apologise. I have edited the remarks to make it make sense (I see now that it was incomplete). 
It is true that you and Steven Slater have edited the article about the BNP which is a tiny and insignificant extremist party in the UK. I did find it strange that two people who edit that article should descend and comment on the NPOV issue raised by Jesanj; especially when Jesanj has also mentioned in the past a claim that I did not understand at all until I googled the matter and it led me to a LaRouche organization website. I have no idea if he did get that comment from Larouche or invented it himself independently but this has aroused suspicion because the LaRouche organization seems to me to be an extreme political organization not at all unlike the BNP. There is also another connection I have found between Jesanj's edits and the LaRouche organization which for the time being I will not reveal publicly. Furthermore, an editor who was found to be a sock of a known LaRouche editor and who was apparently editing from a Larouche IP address was actively involved in supporting Jesanj in another edit dispute I have had with Jesanj. That user has now been blocked from editing WP. Here we have an editor (Jesanj) trying to justify that Palin was talking about NICE when there is no evidence for that. And now at NPONV we have a group of editors with editing connections to matters of extreme right wing / Nazi like organizations all seem to wish to see preserved in WP the same thing. An association, no matter how remote and unlikely between NICE and Death Panels. Jesanj also wants to connect NICE and the IPAB! Both are non mainstream (or extremist) views, which is why I keep removing his multiple attempts to add POV bias to WP. The combination of factors i describe is, I believe, a prima facia case for believing that there may not be any independence in the views being expressed by SOME of the editors who have commented on the NPOV issue. The simple fact is that Palin did not refer to NICE as a death panel and as far as we know, she did not even wish to imply that. She has had plenty of opportunity to clarify her comments and not once has she mentioned NICE. The position of the UK journalists is absurd because it has no foundation and as far as anyone can tell, so only an extremist would wish to support that view. To repeat it twice in different places when there is already a reference to NICE as a potential """"death panel"""" candidate in the article is taking liberties, and up with this we should not put. Which is why I deleted two of the references and left the third in.    """,0

In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

"""

My Offer Anent My Unblock
I am back to pursue my case, not in the form of """"trolling and harassment"""", but in a polite, urbane manner. I ask that you bear with me on this.

History
From alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.
My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. 

I returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to """"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for """"trolling and harassment"""". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.

I returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, """"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?"""" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.

Declarations
I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.
I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.
I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:
Bode Miller
Julia Mancuso
Shaun White
Ted Ligety
Purna
Akola city
2010 Winter Olympics
And many more. . .
I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.

Final Thoughts
The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.
To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you """"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock"""". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?
I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.
I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.
I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark",0

 Attempts to circumvent AfD 

The AfD for Wikifiddler will determine whether the contents will stay under that title, whether they will be merged to a different article, or whether they will be deleted without merge.  Your repeated copying of the entire article to Andrew Orlowski before the conclusion of that AfD is an attempt to circumvent the process, and the fact that you are doing so in bad faith, aware that what you do is wrong, is shown by your falsely flagging it each time as a """"minor edit"""" (disputed edits are never minor edits, refusing to use an edit summary, and your failure to note on either talk page that you are copying the entire contents of one article verbatim into the other.  Your chutzpah in describing it as """"vandalism"""" when these bad-faith edits of yours are reverted is stupidity.  Are you really so very in love with Orlowski that when he rants about Wikipedians who act badly you have to leap to fulfill his prophecy by exhibiting the worst behavior you can calculate?   
I'd have to say the same to you. You have been stupid enough to blank out and revert the article, even though I have extensively added to the material. Since Orlowski clearly is watching Wikipedia closely (see the material you blanked out, you moron) I hope he's watching this discussion and finding it as amusing as I do.

Questions about the Belarusian position
I'm not quite sure about Belarusian ethnic lands - could you be more specifi, because we do have opinions that it was Lithuanian ethnic land, and also that it was Polish ethic lands.

In captioning some images, you used a few pairs of  tags (which in itself didn't affect the size of the text within the captions), but you didn't properly close the tags, so all the text afterwards was made to be really tiny.  When you use a tag, you have to close it by typing a slash into the tag, like this:   I don't know why nobody noticed that the article was messed up until at least three months later, but I've taken care of it.

Also, while I'm at it, when I saw who had made the edit, I was slightly concerned to see the """"bot"""" part of your username—it made me worry that someone had programmed a bot to make edits, but that the person hadn't programmed the bot to correctly close tags.

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa. So I honestly believe that you're about 180 degrees on this one - your statement, while eloquent, was somewhat meaningless, whereas History makes some valid points (the most valid of which is that if you (speaking in the generic, non-threatening second person) call me a """"southerner"""", I will tie you to the back of a pickup truck and drag you to your death while throwing beer cans out the window to hit you in your skull.

For the sake of anyone reading this in the future, expected value is actually fairly easy to determine.  A (barely) simplified version of the formula for this discussion is: Number of Decisions * Average Bet * House Edge = Expected Value.  On a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the EV according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0.053 (edge, rounded) = $0.053.  For 10,000 spins at $1 the EV is $530 meaning the casino wins $530 as stated.  

To determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1/38) multiplied by the payout (35) plus the chances of losing (37/38) multiplied by the loss (-1).  (1/38 * 35) + (37/38 * -1) = -0.05263 or a loss of $0.05263 per dollar bet.  If you do the math this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line.  As a random side note, to quickly determine the payout for any combination of numbers: 36/(numbers bet) - 1 = payout.  For example a street is three numbers so 36/3 - 1 = 11 therefore a street pays 11/1.    08:24, 17 February 2012",0

 Tips for developing country outlines 

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Thank you.The Transhumanist    

P.S.: To discuss the standard design of the country outlines, or of outlines in general, do so on the Outline of knowledge WikiProject talk page.

 Guidelines for outlines 

Guidelines for the development of outlines are being drafted at User:The Transhumanist/Outline of knowledge.

Your input and feedback is welcomed and encouraged.The Transhumanist    

 Please check and fix the government section 

The government section needs to be checked for accuracy.  The initial data placed in the government branches sections was generated by template, and the data didn't fit all countries.

So those sections need to be looked over, and fixed if needed.

Please help.

John C Shumate was my Uncle and my fathers Uncle so I 've heard a few stories from my Dad. I've heard the story written here but working from back in the early days towards the present I've been told that John C Shumate may have been part of the crew of and flown in an observation aircraft as an observer. Not sure what type aircrft. I have a photo of him in his flight suit holding a machine gun. At some point he did become a Pharmacist as this article stated. He did do this type of work in civilian life as stated in a newspaper article I have reporting on him and the incident in which he recieved the silver star. From the stories I heard from my father, it sounded like John C Shumate separated from the military, opened a pharmacy and at some point went back into the military. My father mentioned a story about John C Shumate being in the Military MP's and in one incident taking a group of MP's to remove a bunch of squatters that had moved onto an old deserted military base. Have you heard of Richard Marcinko? He is the founder of Seal Team Six (Counter Terrorist) and Red Cell. Red Cell was a group of Navey Seals tasked with going to different Naval Bases to test security. They basically acted like terrorist, they tried to sneek onto Naval Bases, kidnap high ranking officials, plant explosive etc etc. The reason I mention this is because according to my Dad John C Shumate did this at some in the military. He apparently tested the security of an Air Base because as the story goes, he planted a fake explosive in a culvert(small tunnel) under a runway. Lastly I was told he was in Military Intelligence, but that's all I heard. 21 April 2013 Jeff Thomas161.51.11.2",0

"Those claims were reinserted with sources, but the sources themselves were problematic and I have again removed that material. I do not know Portuguese, but this article fails to support some of the more lurid claims made in a paragraph about some explicit videotapes (phrases cited do not appear at all in that source). I'm not certain, but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all, as from what I can gather it basically is discussing his work. This appears to be a primary document and is the sole source for a controversial claim about his professional life, though Taveira is discussed on that page, and the claim could be true. We cannot go off of primary sources for that kind of thing though.

The BLP issues here are significant, as are questions of weight, since most of the previous version of the article was given over to controversy rather than a discussion of his career. Please do not re-add the material in question without discussing it here on the talk page (I'd also appreciate a note on my talk page if such a discussion begins, though I have watchlisted this).

Hi, Bogdangiusca. Thanks for blocking me. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Since I am clearly a child who needs to sit in the corner with a dunce cap on and learn my manners, this is exactly where I should be! So I see your act of blocking me as an act of kindness and consideration for me and for the entire class, which I have obviously disrupted. The teacher, who is always right, has the certain and inalienable right to do just this. 

Freedom, after all, is a thing which should be ascertained, not by the people, but by the government which rule the people. This is a thing that is agreed upon by all states: monarhcies, socialist states, fascist states republics that have been overtaken by oligarchies, etc. So I cannot do otherwise but to agree that your block is correct.

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".

 Ragusa- Dubrovnik- has never been in Italy!
This article's statement in the part of """"Maratime Republics"""" claiming that Ragusa was in Italy and therefore implying that it was an Italian republic is clearly a mistake.
One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book """"Suze sina razmetnoga"""", was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: """"Dubrovnik, a history"""", written by Robin Harris 2006.
According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry.

Some reflections  on this issue are necessary

First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, """"Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia"""" and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.87.9.19.187  

Romanians in 2007/2008

I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.

 RfC: (Policy) Using bad practices from one article to justify another and possible sock puppetry; and (Politics) Acceptability of aggregated data in """"Election Results"""" section 

Policy
While not getting into the issue of reverting edits without first reaching out to the original editor to understand their motivation (in this case, the deletion of a table),  justifies the reversion of my deletion by pointing to other articles with the same flawed table...which he created!

Examples:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papineau_%28electoral_district%29&diff;=prev&oldid;=654041277 - the above article
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottawa_South&diff;=prev&oldid;=593333525 - Ottawa South
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmonton_Strathcona&diff;=636097681&oldid;=622403799 - Edmonton Strathcona

While we're on this topic, I found an identical table with identical formatting and citation in Toronto Centre...but added by !

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toronto_Centre&oldid;=670004225

This strikes me as possible sock puppetry.  I'm hoping a more sophisticated WP editor can either confirm or deny my hypothesis.

Earl Andrew already admitted to working as a polling firm employee in Ottawa. It seems likely the same user is responsible not only for adding the content cited, but actually generating it in meatspace.  This in itself wouldn't make the content non-NPOV, though one has to wonder why Earl Andrew guards Canadian electoral district pages so jealously (including the """"Political Geography"""" sections which he invented, the topic of our last edit war).  Articles about Canadian electoral districts are not Earl Andrew's soapbox and should not be treated as such.

Further, in the edit history of every single article mentioned above (only a handful, but statistically, that makes the following more damning), Earl Andrew and Fungus Guy are responsible for the lion's share of edits. While I understand that topics as specialized as Canadian politics may have only a handful of active editors, this appears to be a suspicious pattern and should be treated with all due seriousness.

Politics
's """"Redistributed results"""" tables and the identical table added by , are composed of data aggregated from Elections Canada results.  I take no issue with the data, but being aggregated, they are no longer results.  As such, they should at least be moved into a more relevant section with an explanation, if not removed altogether.  Putting the table in the """"Election results"""" section implies they are Elections Canada tallies, quite possibly having the effect of misinforming voters.  And we're right in the middle of an election campaign!

Unsorted
I could have done a lot more editing in the past 4+ years, but instead shied away from larger and more time-consuming edits and rewrites because I felt the end result might be another """"100,000 Edit Man"""" coming out of the woodwork to stifle me.  When more voluminous editors are allowed to browbeat others into submission because they generate a lot of """"content"""" or have a page full of barnstars, it necessarily degrades the quality of WP by reducing the number of editors.  It's hard enough to fight the paid corporate trolls on here, dammit!

"""::::::::::The problem is even the statement """"Jesus is fictional"""" has a large range going from the Jesus of the Gospels is a fiction to Jesus is an entire fiction.  Take Sherlock Holmes for example.  While Holmes is a fictional character he is based on a mixture of Dr Joseph Bell and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle two people who undoubtedly lived and there have been several books and TV programs over the years presenting one or the other as the """"real"""" Sherlock Holmes.  

Similarly, we know that even in Paul's there were """"other Gospels"""" (Galatians 1:6-9) and by the time Irenaeus wrote his Against Heresies (c180 CE) the number of Gospels had definitely increased.  The fact that Irenaeus stated that """"The thirty Æons are not typified by the fact that Christ was baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died."""" (Book II, Chapter 22) is one Joseph Wheless uses with nearly suppressed glee later on going as far as to say """"In the work often cited, Bishop Irenaeus either falsely quotes the Gospel of Mark, or the sacred text has been seriously altered in our present copies"""" regarding some other point.  While Wheless' ax grinding does get on the nerves and there are some really flaky interpretations and misreadings he does raise some good points.  If as the Pro Historical Jesus camp state that Jesus was born c4 BCE and died c36 CE (a space of only 39 years) then how could Irenaeus expressly state Jesus lived at least 11 years longer than this span and that view was """"as the Gospel and all the elders testify""""?  One does not need to be a scholar to realize something clearly is messed up somewhere.

I've extended your block to a week, because I think 24 hours is too lenient here. You've clearly been using at least three accounts to stack votes at ITN (if not elsewhere) and so obciously that it's almost as if you wanted to get blocked. Your actions have shown contempt for consensus and the community in a manner that I've almost never seen before. That you did this at ITN, where things are so much more laid back than in many parts of the project, makes this abuse even more shocking, which is the reason I've extended your block. I will say the following once, and once only: if you ever particiapte in the same discussion on Wikipedia under two identities, logged in or not, in an attempt to stack votes, I will block you indeifnitely and make a motion for a community ban. If I were you, I would be spending the next week reflecting on how I could regain the trust of the community, but if you attempt to evade this block, you will be met with equally stiff sanctions.  | Penny for your thoughts?

"TVTimes images
Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

Thanks for uploading Image:L34419cdd0000 2 15978.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already.

 Why compare only to Windows 2000 features? 

As this issue has clearly caused quite a bit of confusion, I've decided to address it here. Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures.

"And I would very much like to know who you think you are and who appointed you on that page?
For your knowledge Meru was officilly placed here to watch this talk page by mediator Nicholas Turnbull, and this talking is in the process on entering the arbitation comity, so your interventions here are so outplaced as they can be!
I talked with Nicholas Turnbull tonight who disagree with your actions.
You are not appointed here and do not have to make decisions above the heads of the members of the arbitration comity, so you will be very kind to step aside and anihilate your previous doing.
This is not your playground.
I do not know what are your motives to acting as you do as nobody has ever seen you here, but you do seems to go at it with a revenge.
Any reasons who would be worth mentioning now?
You have just been elected admi and the first thing you do is blocking and banning fox from a site you don't know and that you were not aware of for 24 hours ago.
This don't go, you are overstepping wikis rules and previously made decision about this talkpage.
You are acting very unbalanced and provocating a chaos who wasn't there before and who in fact wasn't there as far as the 22th of september. Isn't your role to make things work? 
Another veru very important thing is that you are walking on my article about a Settlement Proposal, that I do recommend you to read carefully, and that you don't have answer to in your recents edits above, and who therefor have no place what so ever under my article and as a part of it.
So moove your articles above, to follow suite of your childrens fights, and leave the growing up doing the right thing.
This article above was the one I was writng and in fact inserted in Meru own talk page before you made your intrance here, and before the situation degenerated that much.
I did it in an attempt to calm tempers down and create a new tangible goal with better opportunity to solve this dilema than revert war and banishments war.
I was stopped at inserting my article by constant editing of article from people fighting, and had each time to perform some changement of my article before saving it, at the end it was too late, you hade arrived, talk like césar, ban a person wihtout valuable and argued explainations, without warning, and taken over the role assignated to Meru by N. Turnbull a few days ago.

By the time I arrived to save my article about burrying the hachet, heads had already rolled, thanks for you.
For your knowledge, you did it at midnight, a saturday evening, and this kind of action will have required the presence of more users, and an agreement between those.
Your opinion about the presence of Igor or not on his talkpage is none of your business, but the business of the arbitration comity and their decision, not yours.
You will have to be more patient and leave to other the right to decide.
Know your chain of command, and the wikis appointed chain of event before a ban can take place, specialy a definitiv ban!
What about the other guy who begin this reverting phase all together? isn't he guilty as well or is he your personnal friend in the discussion forum?
For if this is the case, and if you do have preferences for who is right and who is wrong, so you shouldn't be here and make interventions as well.
You have to stay neutral, but your judgement sounds arbitrary to me, to the point that even your collegue Meru didn't understood what and why you were doing this and disagreed.
Why are you making troubles, and tell me why the alone person who support your actions, is rjb, the exact person known for insulting peoples very often, reverting all the time, and having started this reverting war completely iognoring previous concensus made about the contain of the biography on this talk page.
He was destroying the work of people, to who it had taken several weeks to obtain.
You didn't baned him, why? Is he your socket puppet, or are you his?
What were you doing 6 hours ago and why did you came here?
Did someone warned you?
What triggered your hush at coming by, first time, so late?
I would very much like to know.

You will please move your dispute and different blowings up on one another on a different place, and will take your bad saturday night mood swing somewhere else than on this talkpage, unless you have a satisfactory explaination for what just did happened.
You can't ban Igor when Holger Beck Nielsen is going to make an intervention on this talk page. I hope you know who this person is.
i do notice that the 2 persons who made reverting a war, and insisted on it are ybm and rjb who are both in very close contact with each other, and in fact I am quiet sure that rjb is The socket puppet of YBM. This way he can do it again and again and",0

"""

I am pleased that others have joined this enquiry but I am already dismayed to find that someone has found it necessary to sweep the """"Jewish Question"""" under the carpet when reference on this Talk page had already been made to one incident involving a """"Final Solution"""" of the Jews in England. I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called """"Race laws"""" of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.

Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.

What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)

So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)

The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (""""they killed Jesus""""). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!

Now move along to 1297 and """"bingo!"""" = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in """"ethnic cleansing"""" by wholesale murder and mayhem.

Read your history. Move up to the time of 18th Century and read about the status of Jews in Parliament (how and when they were finally allowed to sit in Parliament.)

The bottom line. The Magna Carta of 1215 needs to be explained: who wrote it and why and what it says and why. What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say """"me too"""" (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  16:12, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)""",0

(We're not quoting her).  However any cite used there must directly, explicitly, associate ex nihilo to the Genesis account.  Given the degree to which this has been a subject of dispute, I'm not being pedantic about this distinction.  To move past this we need a good citation and the reference used has to directly verify the claim.  That's not negotiable.  The no original research policy is quite clear that you can't source a single claim by joining pieces of it from two different references to construct an argument for it.  Find one good, solid and authoritative source that says it, that explicitly identifies it as a widely accepted interpretation of genesis, and we can move on.  Two would be great.    """,0

3. Our webpage reaches more than 200 audio-enthusiasts daily, because it is informative on the subject, and has been since 1997.

"As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian's history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand's book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not. What should not happen is the application of a double-standard.",0

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

"Why Lineal shouldn't be here 

Let's go back to when the Lineal/The Ring title didn't exist. Back then, there was only a World Champion.

Then the title's were split. First between the WBA (Known also by othernames) and WBC, then later the IBF was recognized and even later the WBO.

When the titles were first split, The Ring Magazine created a The Ring title. This belt was awarded to all reigning World Champions. Challengers could win it by beating them. Should someone vacate it, the only way to win it would be to be recognized by The Ring as the No.1 or No.2 fighter in your division and beat the other man ranked 1 or 2 (Some exceptions were made for No.3)

Then came the unfortunate decision in the 1990s by The Ring to stop awarding these titles. But they did not stop ranking fighters. When the No.1 and No.2 fighters fought and a victor came out, that person was dubbed the Lineal Champion.

An example is Floyd Mayweather, Jr.; Lineal Super Featherweight Champion from 1998-2001 (Ring belts were awarded again in 2002).

Mayweather worked his way up to the No.2 spot and challenged No.1 and WBC Champion Genaro Hernández. He was considered the Lineal Champion because there was no The Ring Champion.

Naseem Hamed won the Lineal title and lost it in a period when The Ring titles weren't being awarded. The man who beat him for his title, Marco Antonio Barrera, was later awarded The Ring title. His Lineal title was switched with the The Ring title because the Lineal title only existed as a substitute. 

This applies for Lennox Lewis. He was awarded the The Ring title when awarding them began again in 2002. Therefore, the Lineal title was NOT on the line in his fight with Vitali Klitschko. Any objections?",0

If I'm not mistaken, It sounds like you are telling me to piss off and go edit somewhere else. I certainly do not want to sound uncivil but don't be a Bully or a dick. Specifically which so-called unreliable source were you accusing me of using?  I have not used or added or any sources to the main entry that were not already there or that you did not restore yourself! If you say a source I used on this entry affects my credibility then you show be. Which source specifically are you referring to? Make sure you are accurate because if you are wrong WP:SPADE I will accurately call you a liar.  This is hardly constructive conversation about the entry or the subject matter it should discuss which is the actual purpose of this talk page.  

To accuse me of being a believer in this crap is offensive to me and is taken as personal attack. Now both of you doing it.  Glad I don't have to type this twice so I applies to both of you plus anyone else who wants to jump on. 
It would take a real simpleton to believe the current conspiracy but you'd be much worse off mentally if you still believed that our government plus Canada, UK, and Australia hasn't ever worked together on a series of covert projects designed to spread biological agents over a large scale (across continents) from airplanes. I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility. I've never seen anything like it except with the Japanese.  They never learned any thing negative about their national history in school and rarely consider that conflicting with their established beliefs.

In 1993, Nona was named one of People Magazine’s 50 Most Beautiful People at age 18. She made her runway modeling debut in Paris for Versace in the summer of 1994. A short time later, Nona was signed to the prestigious Ford Modeling Agency. This was a short-lived stint, however, as the curvy Gaye battled bulimia for over three years. Eventually, Nona was forced to make a choice between her health and her modeling career. Nona summed her experience up quite nicely: “I couldn't keep my weight down, and I was like, whatever.” - taken DIRECTLY from http://nona-gaye.net/101facts.htm!",0

This user has vandalised various pages including Neil Young, Annie Besant, Cortez Trio, among others. He has made personal attacks against various users, including myself, and vandalised a series of talk pages. He has been warned multiple times by various users, but has ignored all warnings. I do not know who he is, but he seems to be out to get me (as seen by his posts above) and other users such as Johnleemk. I have been trying to avoid getting into an edit war, but vandalism is not acceptable on wikipedia so I revert it. I have never delt with such large scale vandalism before and am not sure how to handle it. Any help would be appreciated.   

The Cortez Trio is a Canadian jazz-folk trio composed of Justin Besant (piano), Peter Georgas (vocals/guitar), and Frank Grek (percussion).

This link: Them Again shows """"Baby Blue"""" as one of the songs for the recording session for Them Again.  Here's also a mention in J Rogan's book that the arrangement was actually worked out separately before the session for Them Again: """"Like everyone else on the pop scene in late 1965, [Tommy] Scott readily acknowledged the importance of Bob Dylan and was eager for Morrison to cover """"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"""". After several hours work on the Dylan track at Regent Sound, pianist Phil Coulter went home and Scott called a break.  'The number wasn't going down', Scott remembers. 'Van wasn't sure. Then the guys said he didn't fancy it and thought it was cheap because I'd tried to go after the 'Here Comes The Night' tempo.' Scott reconsidered and after picking up a blues riff, a new arrangement emerged, apparently with added piano work from Peter Bardens. Engineer Bill Farley modulated the sound and Morrison provided one of his most expressive vocals."""" pp. 137-138 Rogan, Van Morrison: No Surrender.

"I think it's a good idea to have both separate sub-lists and the full main list. George, you've made a good start splitting off the 5 victories list, but I'd like to make a few changes before we go and split up the whole list. I think we should follow the example of Airline codes-All. If you look at that page it is a very long list of airlines, but if you try to edit it you will see it is actually just a bunch of sublists on separate pages put together. My proposal is to have the main page List of World War I flying aces, and then many subpages List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (A-F) List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (G-Q), List of World War I flying aces credited with 5 victories (R-Z), etc. (I chose those names based on other list series, and so that they will be able to stand as lists on their own.) Each list will then need some extra coding, which I can do. And we'd have to create List of World War I flying aces/Page top and List of World War I flying aces/Page bottom (easily done).

"I think that a separate article is needed for the Confessional Lutheran movement because it is not historically a part of the confessing movement at all. The movement to confessional Lutheranism arose in the 1830s as a reaction to pietism on the one side and rationalism on the other. It arrives in America with the emigration of groups like the Saxons of Missouri and Grabau's group in Western New York. Folk like F.C.D. Wyneken come on board as they read Luther and the Book of Concord. Unlike the confessing movement, the Lutheran Confessionalists do not comprimise easily on matters of doctrine and practice. So, although the name's nearly the same, the movement is in fact distinct.  10:55, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)",0

Dude, don't tell me what I am finding and not finding in the dictionary, when what you are saying is contradicted by the direct and immediate evidence of my own eyes.  Root س و د (from which words meaning """"black"""" in the sense of an abstract color are derived) is defined on page 513 of the dictionary, while root ز ن ج (whose historically-changing range of meanings I have adequately explained in past comments on this talk page above) is defined on pages 445-446 of the book.  These entries are over 50 pages apart in the dictionary.

I'm perfectly happy to add a formal reference to the Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic in this article, but the process is not facilitated by you telling me things which I know are factually false.

And I was the one who told you several times above the information about the three-fold distinction of the early Arabs between nubah النوبة, ħabaš الحبش, and zanj زنج.  Usually, the inhabitants of nubah and ħabašwere not called Zanjis by Arabs (though occasionally they were), but when other areas of Africa (beyond the northeast Nile and coastal areas) later came into the gographical horizon of the Arabs, the inhabitants of those areas were often called Zanjis or Zunūj.
